Petroleum-based plastic materials as pollutants raise concerns because of their impact on
the global ecosystem and on animal and human health. There is an urgent need to remove
plastic waste from the environment to overcome the environmental crisis of plastic
pollution. This review describes the natural and unique ability of fungi to invade substrates
by using enzymes that have the capacity to detoxify pollutants and are able to act on
nonspecific substrates, the fungal ability to produce hydrophobins for surface coating to
attach hyphae to hydrophobic substrates, and hyphal ability to penetrate three dimensional
substrates. Fungal studies on macro- and microplastics biodegradation have shown that
fungi are able to use these materials as the sole carbon and energy source. Further
research is required on novel isolates from plastisphere ecosystems, on the use of
molecular techniques to characterize plastic-degrading fungi and enhance enzymatic
activity levels, and on the use of omics-based technologies to accelerate plastic waste
biodegradation processes. The addition of pro-oxidants species (photosensitizers) and the
reduction of biocides and antioxidant stabilizers used in the plastic manufacturing process
should also be considered to promote biodegradation. Interdisciplinary research and
innovative fungal strategies for plastic waste biodegradation, as well as ecofriendly
manufacturing of petroleum-based plastics, may help to reduce the negative impacts of
plastic waste pollution in the biosphere.

The market for petroleum-based plastic products has had a great expansion in industries
such as the construction, automotive and packaging industries in the twentieth century
(Lintsen et al., 2017). Plastic materials have been very successful due to their low cost and
weight, as well as their versatility and durability, making them present in nearly every
material used in human daily life (Andrady and Neal, 2009) (Table 1). The use of plastics
has increased twenty fold since 1964, and it is expected to double by 2035 (Velis, 2014). It
has been reported that the world’s synthetic plastic production will be approximately 1800
million tons in 2050 (Gallo et al., 2018) and approximately 12,000 million metric tons of
plastic waste will be in the environment by that year (Geyer et al., 2017;
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04565-2.pdf). Approximately 90% of the
products made with plastic are used once and then discarded
(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04565-2.pdf). Therefore, the disposal of used
plastic materials and plastic packaging materials has become a global concern due to their
high recalcitrance resulting in their long persistence in the environment. It is estimated that
the packaging sector constitutes 39.9% of the plastic market and approximately 42% of
plastic waste within a city’s solid waste comes only from packing materials, such as
polyethylene (PE) (Table 1) (Biron, 2013; Narancic and O’Connor, 2017). Plastic pollution
is spread throughout the world’s oceans by prevailing winds and surface currents, with
some of it ending up in the digestive system of marine animals, which finally affects human
health (Eriksen et al., 2014; Quero and Luna, 2017). It has been estimated that almost 6.4
million tons of waste is introduced into marine environments annually (Agamuthu, 2018). In
terms of the global composition of marine litter, plastics account for 62.31%. Plastics also
contribute 49% of the litter composition in the seafloor and 81% on the sea surface
(Litterbase; https://litterbase.awi.de/). Plastics are differentiated according to their
structural arrangements, physical properties and applications. They can be homopolymers
or heteropolymers if they are derived from identical or different (but often similar) types of
monomers, respectively (Table 1). Plastics are classified on the basis of their properties
and the chemical structure of the polymer's backbone and side chains in thermoplastics
(uncrosslinked plastics, which are recyclable) and thermosets (or duroplastics) (contain a
high density of chemical crosslinks, which are not recyclable) (Eyerer, 2010;
http://www.ilocis.org/documents/chpt77e.htm) (Fig. 1). Manufacturing petroleum-based
plastics requires crude oil and natural gas (two components of crude petroleum) as raw
materials (Fig. 2). Several operations are performed to refine the crude oil, such as
distillation, followed by cracking to provide the intermediates to form different polymers
through polymerization and/or polycondensation reactions (Eyerer, 2010;
http://www.ilocis.org/documents/chpt77e.htm). Processing plastics into end products
requires the addition of some additives, which also cause environmental pollution. For
example, some plastic additives, such as plasticizers (e.g., phthalates), flame retardants
antioxidants (e.g., boric acid, brominated ﬂame retardants), antioxidants and UV stabilizers
(e.g., bisphenol A, butylated hydroxytoluene), heat stabilizers (e.g., cadmium and lead
compounds), slip agents (e.g., fatty acid amides), curing agents (e.g.,
diaminodiphenylmethane), biocides (e.g., arsenic compounds), pigments (e.g., cadmium
compounds) and others are incorporated into thermoplastics to achieve the desired final
functional properties (Hahladakis et al., 2018) (Fig. 2). The most produced thermoplastics

are high and low density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) (the
polyolefins), followed by polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS)
(http://www.ilocis.org/documents/chpt77e.htm). Plastic pollution in landfills causes visual
derogation of the landscape, contamination of soils with small plastic particles, and the
release of greenhouse gases and hazardous chemicals (Mudgal, 2011; de SouzaMachado et al., 2018) (Table 1). In addition, the presence of microplastics and
nanoplastics in the environment is growing rapidly due to the global ubiquity of macroplastics and the technological developments of using new micro- and nanoplastic
materials. These materials might have major chemical and physical impacts on the
environment and human health because of their unique physiochemical micro- and
nanoscale properties (Mattsson et al., 2015; Waring et al., 2018; Peiponen et al., 2019).
Due to these concerns, there is a need to search for alternatives for cleaning up the
environment. Bioremediation is considered the most desirable approach for eliminating
many environmental pollutants. Bioremediation is an environmentally friendly and low-cost
technology which can be undertaken on site since it involves natural processes (Das and
Adholeya, 2012). In this sense, fungi have promising practical applications to remediate
environments polluted by plastics using their powerful enzymes.

2. ABILITY OF FUNGI AS DEGRADERS OF COMPLEX POLYMERS

lP

Fungi constitute a large and diverse kingdom of eukaryotic organisms morphologically
classiﬁed as yeasts, ﬁlamentous fungi, or dimorphic fungi. These organisms can be
saprotrophs (decomposing dead material), obligated or opportunistic organisms
(decomposers, mutualists or pathogens) (Schmit and Mueller, 2007; Črešnar and Petrič,
2011). Fungi are found in different environments and some of them have evolved to adapt
and grow even in terrestrial and marine environments under extreme conditions
(Raghukumar, 2017). Most fungi are aerobic, but anaerobic fungi have been found in
freshwater lakes, landﬁll sites, and the rumen of herbivores (Ivarsson et al., 2016). Fungi
have the capacity to extend through substrates in their search for nutriments with their
filamentous network structure, exploring and growing in places that are more difficult to
reach for other microorganisms. Filamentous fungi are the most commonly classified
species of fungi to date. These organisms have developed an extraordinary ability to adapt
to changing environments and to tolerate several types of pollutants. They are able to
break down and use these pollutants to grow or to make their chemical components
available to other microorganisms. As a consequence, ﬁlamentous fungi play a crucial role
in the degradation and mineralization of diverse environmental pollutants by catalyzing
important chemical reactions (Črešnar and Petrič, 2011). Fungi are heterotrophic
organisms that feed by absorbing nutrients from outside their cells. They release digestive
enzymes by exocytosis outside of their hyphae, which break down macro and organic
molecules into smaller organic compound to absorb them back up, releasing CO 2 and H2O
under aerobic conditions (and CH4 under anaerobic conditions) if mineralization of the
substrate occurs (Pathak and Navneet, 2017) (Fig. 3). Fungi have various extraordinary
strategies to counteract numerous complex compounds, some of them pollutant and toxic
substances (Olicón-Hernández et al., 2017). These strategies include a powerful
enzymatic system, the ability of adsorption and the production of natural biosurfactants
(i.e., hydrophobins), which enable them to use polymers (i.e., plastics) as a source of
3

carbon and electrons, providing them with cellular materials and an energy source,
respectively (Fig. 4).
2.1. Intracellular and extracellular enzymatic systems

Fungi have a machinery of unspecific enzymes able to catalyze diverse reaction
mechanisms that make them highly convenient for pollutants degradation (e.g., petroleumbased polymers), which is possible due to their different mechanisms in combination with
both their intracellular and extracellular enzymatic systems. The intracellular enzymatic
system acts as an internal mechanism for detoxification and plays a major role in fungal
adaptation (Jeon et al., 2016; Olicón-Hernández et al., 2017; Schwartz et al., 2018). This
enzymatic system is mediated by the cytochrome P450 family (CYP) epoxidases (Phase I
enzymes) and transferases (Phase II enzymes). Phase I and phase II enzymes include
those enzymes involved in oxidation and conjugation reactions, respectively (Schwartz et
al., 2018) (Fig. 4). CYP are a large family of enzymes and heme-containing
monooxygenases (mainly) that are able to catalyze various enzymatic reactions (i.e. the
metabolism of aliphatic, alicyclic, and aromatic molecules), resulting in epoxidation,
hydroxylation, dealkylation, sulfoxidation, desulfuration, deamination, dehalogenation, and
N-oxide reduction (Shin et al., 2018). Fungi possess more diverse CYP families than
animals, plants, or bacteria (Shin et al., 2018). The evolutionary conserved (CYP51) and
fungi-speciﬁc (CYP61 and CYP56) P450 enzymes are essential for primary metabolism,
enabling the preservation of the hyphal wall integrity and the formation of the spore outer
wall, respectively (Črešnar and Petrič, 2011). CYP isoforms are anchored in the
membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, having their active sites connected to both the
cytosolic and membrane environments so they can accept substrates from both cellular
surroundings (Šrejber et al., 2018). CYP contains three cofactors (NADPH+H+, FAD and
heme) and two enzymes (NADPH:CYP reductase and cytochrome P-450 hydrolase) (Fig.
4). Additionally, the extracellular enzymatic system consists of the hydrolytic system that
produces hydrolases, which is responsible for polysaccharide degradation, and an
extraordinary and unspecific oxidative system involved in the breakdown of complex
structures (e.g., lignin degradation) (Sánchez, 2009). Hydroxylation can be considered a
biotransformation approach for bioremediation processes since it increases the solubility of
pollutants and therefore reduces the bioaccumulation potential (Olicón-Hernández et al.,
2017). The unspecific oxidative system is formed mainly by nonspecific oxidoreductases,
including enzymes such as class II peroxidases (manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase
and versatile peroxidase), laccases, dye decolorizing peroxidases and unspeciﬁc
peroxygenases. This oxidative system is able to oxidize a wide range of substrates and is
a powerful tool for environmental cleaning. These enzymes transfer electrons from organic
substrates to molecular oxygen (laccases) by oxidation-reduction reactions using H2O2 as
an electron accepting co-substrate (class II peroxidases and dye peroxidases), or by
epoxidation, aromatic peroxygenation and sulfoxidation, among others reactions
(unspeciﬁc peroxygenases) (Karich et al., 2017). This enzymatic complex is produced
mainly by wood-degrading fungi, such as basidiomycetes (Sánchez, 2009).
2.2. Fungal production of hydrophobins

of

Hydrophobins are surface hydrophobic proteins (70-350 amino acids in length) produced
by fungi that contain eight cysteine residues and form four disulfide bridges in a conserved
pattern (Wessels, 1996; Wösten and Scholtmeijer, 2015). These proteins are involved in
the formation of aerial structures of filamentous fungi (such as hyphae, fruiting bodies, and
spores) and in the attachment of hyphae to hydrophobic surfaces. However, the bacterial
adhesion to the plastic surface depends on the physicochemical surface and bacterial
properties rather than on biological processes (Artham et al. 2009; Urbanek et al., 2018).
Lobelle and Cunliffe (2011) reported that bacteria can colonize plastic; however, there is
no evidence of potential degradation during early attachment. Fungal hydrophobins selfassemble into amphipathic films (monolayers) on hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces
(Wessels, 1996; Kulkarni et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017). Based on their hydrophobic
patterns, the morphology of the monolayers and their solubility in detergents,
hydrophobins are divided in two classes. Class I hydrophobins are highly insoluble in
aqueous solutions and form functional amyloid fibers organized in layers with rodlet
morphology. Class II hydrophobins are soluble in aqueous dilutions of organic solvents
and their monolayer lacks the rodlet morphology and is less stable (Wu et al., 2017).
Several hydrophobins have been isolated from different fungi. Normally, each fungus
contains a number of different hydrophobins (Table 2). These proteins represent an
important tool for bioremediation purposes since they act as biosurfactants improving
substrate mobility and they increase the bioavailability. It has been reported that the
chemical structure of fungi biosurfactants involves, among other things, sophorolipids,
glycolipids, protein-lipid/polysaccharide complexes, and glycolipoproteins (OlicónHernández et al., 2017). The extraordinary properties of hydrophobins (such as their
strong adhesion, high surface activity and the formation of various self-assembled
structures that are often highly insoluble) have allowed them to be used to promote the
growth of cells on a hydrophobic surface for applications in medical implants. In fact, a
hydrophobin coating can improve the growth and morphology of ﬁbroblasts on a plastic
surface (e.g., polystyrene, Teflon, etc.) (Hektor and Scholtmeijer 2005; Pistelli et al., 2017).

3. DEGRADATION PROCESS OF PETROLEUM-BASED POLYMERS BY FUNGI
3.1. Enzyme involved in the degradation of petroleum-based plastics
Fungal degradation of polymers such as PP, PVC, polyethylene terephthalate (PET),
polyesters and microplastics has been studied (Table 3). Primarily ascomycetes, followed
by basidiomycetes and zigomycetes, have been found to be able to degrade petroleumbased plastics (Table 3). Plastic biodegradation processes can be evaluated through
microbial growth and/or changes in the polymer itself. Fungal growth can be assessed
mainly by enzyme assays, biochemical oxygen demand, biomass production and carbon
dioxide production under aerobic conditions. The effects of fungi on the physiochemical
properties of plastics include changes in the crystallinity, molecular weight, tensile
properties, extent of fragmentation and functional groups found on the plastic surface
(Restrepo-Flórez et al., 2014). The main techniques used to follow these changes are:
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
x-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS). Fungal growth causes a decrease (consumption)
of carbonyl groups from the original oxidation products (e.g., esters, lactones and ketones)

(Ammala et al., 2011). The biodegradation and biodeterioration (break down in properties)
of plastics by fungi have been demonstrated by several researchers. However, the
enzymes that are involved in the processes have been investigated in only a very few
studies (Table 3). For example, El-Morsy et al. (2017) demonstrated the protease,
esterase and lipase production in polyurethane biodegradation with Monascus sp. strains.
Russell et al. (2011) reported enhanced serine hydrolase activity of Pestalotiopsis
microspore when it was grown on polyester polyurethane (impranil) as its sole carbon
source. In addition, the ascomycetes Zalerion maritimum and Gloeophyllum trabeum were
reported as able to degrade microplastics (Krueger et al., 2015; Paço et al., 2017). Ameen
et al. (2015) found that a consortium of ascomycete strains were able to degrade LDPE,
showing laccase, manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) activities
(Table 3). It has been suggested that fungal enzymes are able to decrease the length of
PE chains and that once this occurs, a metabolic pathway for the degradation of PE can
be proposed (Restrepo-Flórez et al., 2014). It has been reported that in general, fungi are
better degraders of PE and polyurethane than bacteria (Pathak and Navneet, 2017;
Muhonja et al., 2018). On the other hand, the enzymes involved in PET degradation are
typical serine hydrolases such as cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74), carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1)
and lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) (Danso et al., 2019). Among the reported microbial polyester
hydrolases, cutinases and their homologues have shown the greatest potential for PET
hydrolysis (Kawai et al., 2019). Liebminger et al. (2007) isolated polyesterase from
Penicillium citrinum able to hydrolyze PET pellets. Ronkvist et al. (2009) found that
Thermomyces (formerly Humicola) insolens and Fusarium solani had catalytic activities of
cutinase when low-crystallinity (7%) PET films were used as substrates (Table 3).

3.2. Biodegradation pathways

Jo

ur

Figure 5 shows a hypothetical biodegradation pathway for PE by Aspergillus terreus under
aerobic conditions, which was developed based on previously identified intermediate
compounds by GC-MS after incubation of 30 d (Balasubramanian et al., 2014). The
proposed PE biodegradation pathway would begin with the activation of a MnP, enzyme
with enhanced activity during PE biodegradation (Ameen et al., 2015). The catalytic active
site of MnP includes aspartate (Asp179), glutamate (GluS5 and GluS9), a heme
propionate, and two water molecules (one of them is a free water molecule)
(Sundaramoorthy et al., 1994). The heme propionate has 2 propionate groups, one of
them bound to a water molecule and the other bound to Mn 2+. The catalytic activity of the
MnP (heme MnP) would start from free radicals in acidic conditions with optimal activity at
pH 5 (Chandra et al., 2017) (a). During this step, the hydrogen peroxide, an oxidizing
agent added to the culture medium, would be homolytically cleaved, generating two
hydroxyl free radicals which would bind to Fe2+ and the hydrogen water of the heme MnP,
respectively, and releasing a water molecule (a). As a result, hydroxy-ferryl center free
radical and porphyrin π-cation free radical could be formed, and hydrogen in the hydroxyferryl center free radical would bind to the nitrogen of the porphyrin π-cation free radical to
stabilize the molecule (b). The oxygen radical of the oxy-ferryl center free radical would
oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+, forming oxy-ferryl center. Additionally, a group propionate would bind
to H+ of the hydroxyl group, oxidizing Mn2+ to Mn3+ and would form an oxy ferryl centerMnP free radical complex (c). PE would enter the active site of the heme MnP and the Mn
free radical would react with PE, which would be broken down into small molecules, such

of

as dodecane free radical, ethyl free radicals, alkanes (e.g., dodecane, nonadecane, etc.),
and ethanol (e). Ethanol would be oxidized into acetic acid (f), which would enter into the
Krebs cycle (g). Dodecane free radical would enter the MnP catalytic site (h) and would be
oxidized to dodecane (i). Alternatively, dodecane free radical and dodecane would be
subsequently oxidized to dodecanol (j), dodecanal (k) and dodecanoic acid (l), which
would react with an ethyl free radical to form tetradecanoic acid (m). Tetradecanoic acid
would react with CoA to form tetradecanoyl CoA (n), which would undergo β-oxidation to
form acetyl-CoA units which would enter into the Krebs (o) (White and Rusell, 1994;
Sundaramarthy et al. 1994; Balasubramanian et al. 2014). The substrate-free MnP would
then have an unoccupied substrate-binding site (p), attracting another substrate molecule
for a new catalytic cycle (q). On the other hand, cutinases possess a catalytic triad that is
composed of a serine (Ser), a histidine (His), and an aspartate (Asp) residue (Martínez et
al., 1992; Danso et al., 2019). They can also contain several disulfide bonds formed by
cysteine residues, which promote thermal stability and specific binding to PET (Danso et
al., 2019). Figure 6 shows a PET hypothetical biodegradation pathway by a cutinase of F.
solani. The catalytic active site of this cutinase includes; Ser 120, Asp 175 and His 188
(Martínez et al., 1992). The proposed PET biodegradation pathway would begin with the
activation of two molecules of cutinase. The electrons from the oxygen of serine would
react with the carbonyl group of PET (a), which would form a serine-terephatalate complex
and two ether compounds (b). Alternatively, PET can be hydrolyzed by cutinase, which
would be broken down into mono-(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), bis-(hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (BHET), and terephthalic acid (TPA) (Han et al., 2017) (c). Oxygen of the
ether compound would form a covalent bond with the hydrogen of histidine, which would
undergo hydrolysis to form ethylene glycol (d). Ethylene glycol would be converted to a
series of intermediates by oxidation to form glyoxylate, which would enter into the Krebs
cycle (e). Serine-terephthalate complex and the Asp-His residue would be hydrolyzed
using two water molecules (f). The oxygen from the serine would bind the hydrogen from
the histidine (g) and two molecules of cutinase and TPA would be released (h). Cutinase
molecules would begin a new catalytic cycle (i) and TPA would be hydrolyzed to cis-4,5dihydroxycyclohexan-1(6),2-diene-1,4-dicarboxylate (j), which would form catechol by
decarboxylation (k). Catechol would be hydrolyzed to 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde
(l), which would then be oxidized to 2-oxopent-4-enoate (m). This last compound would be
converted to a series of intermediates by hydrolysis to form pyruvate (n) which would enter
into the Krebs cycle (e).
4. CONCLUDING REMARKS
It can be concluded that petroleum-based plastics are necessary in human life and
represent an ever increasing market. The development of diverse industrial sectors (e.g.,
pharmaceutical) has resulted in the production of several plastic materials at micro and
nano scale levels (microbeads and nanobeads). The pollution of macroplastics is an
environmental crisis of great concern, but environmental pollution from micro and nano
scale plastics is even more disturbing since it is possible to fight that what is visible but
smaller plastics are a threat which cannot be seen. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
provide an effective and harmless solution to plastic pollution. Several studies have been
undertaken to determine the plastic biodegradation by fungi, however, very little is known

about the enzymes involved in the plastic biodegradation process and on the plastic
biodegradation pathways. Fungi have a great potential for reducing the negative impacts
of plastic pollution due to their specific characteristics, such as their enzymatic system with
the capacity for pollutant detoxification and unspecificity of substrates, their ability to
produce hydrophobin for surface coating to attach hyphae to hydrophobic substrates, and
their cellular ability to penetrate three dimensional substrates. Future research should
focus on novel isolates from plastisphere ecosystems (a new habitat that may host fungal
strains able to use plastic polymers for growth), on the use of molecular tools to
characterize plastic-degrading fungi and improve enzymatic activity levels, and on the use
of omics technologies to accelerate plastic waste biodegradation processes. On the other
hand, it is of crucial importance to balance the plastics formulation to promote plastic
waste biodegradation; biocides and antioxidant stabilizers should be reduced or even
eliminated (after all, 90% of the products made with plastic are used once and then
discarded) and pro-oxidants (photo sensitizers) have to be incorporated into plastic
manufacturing processes to promote biodegradation. Interdisciplinary investigations and
innovative fungal strategies for plastic waste biodegradation, as well as ecofriendly
manufacturing of petroleum-based plastics, may reduce plastic waste pollution and help to
clean the biosphere.

Fig. 1. Classiﬁcation and structure of petroleum based plastics. Plastics are classified as
thermoplastics and thermosets (duroplastics). Thermoplastics are uncrosslinked plastics
that can be softened by the application of heat (which makes them recyclable materials).
Duroplastics, or thermosetting materials, are polymers that contain a high density of
chemical crosslinks, resulting in a close-meshed crosslinking of macromolecules (which
are not possible to recycle).

Fig. 2. Schematic representation of the manufacturing of petroleum-based plastics with an
example of a finished product. Manufacturing petroleum-based plastics requires crude oil
and natural gas as raw materials. Several operations are performed to refine the crude oil,
such as distillation, followed by cracking to provide intermediates to form different
polymers (thermoplastics or thermosets) through polymerization and/or polycondensation
reactions. Processing plastics into end products requires the addition of additives such as
plasticizers, flame retardant antioxidants, antioxidants and UV stabilizers, heat stabilizers,
curing agents, pigments, and others.

Fig. 3. General scheme of biodegradation of complex polymers (e.g., petroleum-based
plastics) by a fungal cell (hypha). Fungi are heterotrophic organisms that feed by
absorbing nutrients from outside their cells. In general, the hyphal structure can be
organized into 4 zones: the apical growth zone, absorption zone, storage zone and
senescence zone, each of them with a specific metabolic activity. Hyphae release
digestive enzymes by exocytosis outside of hyphae, which break down macro and organic
molecules into smaller organic compounds and absorb them back up, releasing CO 2 and
H2O (the mineralization of a substrate under aerobic conditions).

Fig. 4. Schematic representation of fungal mechanisms for the degradation of complex
polymers (e.g., petroleum-based plastics). These fungal mechanisms include a powerful
intracellular and extracellular enzymatic system, the ability of adsorption, and the
production of natural biosurfactants (i.e., hydrophobins), which enable them to use
complex polymers as a source of carbon and electrons to provide cellular materials and an
energy source, respectively.

Fig. 5. A proposed catalytic cycle for the biodegradation of PE using the heme manganese
peroxidase (heme MnP). The dashed line shows the compounds identified (acetic acid,
dodecane, dodecanal and tretradecanoic acid) previously by GC-MS during PE
biodegradation by A. terreus under aerobic conditions (Balasubramanian et al., 2014). The
rest of the compounds shown in the biodegradation pathway were proposed based on
previous reports (White and Rusell, 1994). The catalytic activity of the heme MnP starts
from free radicals in acidic conditions. The PE hypothetical biodegradation pathway shows
that MnP would eventually mineralize this polymer, generating a PE catalytic cycle.
Fig. 6. A proposed catalytic cycle for the biodegradation of PET using a cutinase of F.
solani. The catalytic active site of this cutinase includes; Ser 120, Asp 175 and His 188
(Martínez et al., 1992). The proposed PET biodegradation pathway would begin with the
activation of two molecules of cutinase by the electrons transfer from the hydrogen atom of
histidine to the hydroxyl group of serine. The PET hypothetical biodegradation pathway
shows that cutinase would eventually mineralize this polymer, generating a PET catalytic
cycle.

Fungal strains were efficient at PE degradation
based on weight loss and reduction in tensile
strength after 60 d (FTIR and SEM were used).
PVC showed adhesion and growth of C.
globosum fertile structures (perithecia) after 28
d.
T. viride and A. nomius reduced the weight of
LDPE films after 45 d of growth.
LDPE sheets showed a weight reduction after
4 months.
Growing cultures had a visible clearance zone
('halo') as a result of enzymatic plastic
degradation (between 6-14 d of growth).

Monascus sp. was the most efficient strain in
PPU degradation. SEM micrographs showed
complex formations between the PPU and
hyphae (after 14 d). Protease, esterase, and
lipase were detected.
Morphological damages were observed on PE
sheets after 60 d (SEM and FTIR spectroscopy
were used).
This marine fungus was able to utilize PE
microplastics, showing a decrease in both the
size and mass of the pellets after 28 d
(requiring minimum nutrients).

El-Morsy et

A PPU ﬁlm was completely degraded into
smaller pieces after 2 months (SEM and FTIR
were used).
F. oxysporum and A. niger had the greatest
biodegradation efficiency of LDPE and PU
after 90 d. Morphological damage and a halo
around the growing culture on both LDPE and
PU media were observed.

Khan et al.,
