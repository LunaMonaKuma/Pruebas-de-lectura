Abstract
Plastics are synthetic polymers that are widely used in every field of life every day. Along
with the increasing use of plastic, the amount of plastic waste produced and accumulated to
environment will also increase. If the plastic waste is not handled properly, it will pollute the
environment and threaten many living things including humans. Biodegradation is a promising
method for dealing with plastic waste. This method includes many microbes including fungi such
as Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. as its biodegradation agents. Some plastics degrading fungi
produce many specific enzymes that catalyze the degradation of plastic polymer into simpler and
smaller fragments including oligomer, dimer, and monomer through several steps including
biodeterioration, depolymerization, assimilation, and mineralization. The fragmented plastic
particles are absorbed and used by plastic degrading fungi as their energy and carbon sources.
Biodegradation is the appropriate method to overcome the plastics pollution because this method
has no side effects as the conventional methods.
Key words – Biodegradation – Biodeterioration – Depolymeration – Fungi – Plastics Waste
Introduction
Plastics are relatively inexpensive, lightweight, resistant to water, and strong products can be
used for many purposes. This polymer is widely used in almost all fields of life. The use of plastic
products is likely to increase by 9% every year (Thompson et al. 2009). World plastic production
reached 400 million tons annually (UNEP 2018). Unfortunately, plastic contains various toxic
components hazardous to living things. The massive use of plastic products leads to plastics
accumulation in the environment (Thompson et al. 2009), because these pollutants require a very
long time to be completely degraded in nature, thus pollute the water, land, and air (Kathiresan
2003, Soud 2019).
In Western Europe, around 7.4% of municipal solid wastes are plastic wastes. As much as
65% of that amount is polyethylene/polypropylene, 15% polystyrene, 10% PVC, 5% PET, and the
rest come from other plastic polymers (Premraj & Doble 2005). In 2010, China ranked first among
the countries that were top producer of plastic wastes generating 27.7% of total global mismanaged
plastic wastes or around 8.82 MMT/year (Millions of Metric Tons per Year). Indonesia was at
second position (10.1%) in the list of the world's total mismanaged plastic wastes, followed by
Philippines (third, 5.9%), Vietnam (fourth, 5.8%), Sri Lanka (fifth, 5%), Thailand (sixth, 3.2%),
Egypt (seventh, 3%), Malaysia (eighth, 2.9%), Nigeria (ninth, 2.7%), Bangladesh (tenth, 2.5%), and

United States (twentieth, 0.9%) (Jambeck et al. 2015). North-East Asia was the highest single-use
plastic producer in 2014, 26% in particular, followed by North America (21%), Middle East (17%),
Europe (16%), Asia and the Pacific (12%), Central and South America (4%), and the former Uni
Soviet countries (3%). Based on the industrial sector, packaging was the sector that consumed the
most single-use plastic or about 36%. Plastic production in the building and construction sector was
16%, textiles 14%, consumer and institutional products 10%, transportation 7%,
electronics/electrical 4%, machinery industry 1%, and about 12% used in other sectors (UNEP
2018).
Plastic wastes have become contaminants on land and in the aquatic environment. Thus,
effective plastic waste processing methods are needed (Mandan & Arya 2017). The common
methods used in processing plastic wastes are landfill, incineration, and recycling. Each of these
methods has its weaknesses. Thus, they are not effective in solving plastics pollution. Landfill
plastic wastes processing requires a long time without rotting. Incineration treatment will produce
toxic gases into the environment (Al-Salem et al. 2009, Hopewell et al. 2009, Gan & Zhang 2019).
The incineration process of PVC, PET, PS, and PE wastes produces carcinogenic substances as
PAHs, nitro-PAHs, dioxins, and others (Al-Salem et al. 2009, Yang et al. 2018). Additionally,
recycling plastic wastes is also relatively expensive (Al-Salem et al. 2009, Hopewell et al. 2009,
Gan & Zhang 2019).
Some plastic wastes processing techniques that include energetic, chemical, and biological
methods were developed three decades ago. The energetic processing technique uses radiation
energies such as gamma rays, ion beams, electrons, and UV rays. The plastic wastes chemical
processing technique involves certain chemicals such as acids and alkalis. While the biological
plastic wastes processing technique utilizes various kinds of microbes, this technique is known as
biodegradation (Premraj & Doble 2005). Of all the methods of handling plastic wastes,
biodegradation is recognized as the most promising and environmentally safe method of processing
plastic wastes (Gan & Zhang 2019). Biodegradation is the processing of plastic waste using
microorganisms (Verma & Gupta 2019).
Types of Plastic
Plastics can be divided into thermoplastics and thermosets. Thermoplastic is a group of
plastics that can be remelted and reprocessed back into a product as well as recyclable. Meanwhile,
thermosets or thermosetting is a plastic group that cannot be remelted because the molecular bonds
contained in that plastic polymers are tightly bound in crosslink (Chan & Ji 1999, Albano et al.
2009, Choi et al. 2009, Al-Salem et al. 2010, Bărbută et al. 2010, Choi et al. 2005, Mohammadian
& Haghi 2013). The four most commonly used plastic polymers in daily life are high-density
polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene
terephthalate (PET). They are the most common sources of plastic pollutants that are mainly used
as plastic bags (Drzyzga & Prieto 2018). Polyethylene (PE) is the most widely used plastic. The use
of that polymer reached 29.6% of the total daily plastic used, followed by polypropylene (PP) as
much as 18.9%, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 10.4%. Meanwhile, the use of polyurethane (PUR)
reached 7.4%, polystyrene (PS) reached 7.1% and the use of PET reached 6.9% (Wu et al. 2017,
Yang et al. 2018).
Polyethylene (PE) is a synthetic plastic that has a high molecular weight, complex threedimensional structure, and hydrophobic nature (Hadad et al. 2005, Shah 2009). Polyethylene is
composed of stable polymers containing bonds composed of ethylene monomers (Alshehrei 2017).
The stability of the polymers makes this plastic resistant to degradation in nature (Nandi & Joshi
2013). PP is a synthetic plastic composed of a heat-and-chemical-resistant polymer. Because of this
property, PP is resistant to degradation (Khoironi et al. 2019).
PET has two hydroxyls (OH) and dicarboxylic aromatic acids consisting of aromatic carbon
rings and two carboxyls (CO2H) (Venkatachalam et al. 2012, Farzi et al. 2019, Webb et al. 2013).
This plastic is synthesized by involving two chemical reactions (Kint & Muñoz-Guerra 1999,

2

Awaja & Pavel 2005, Webb et al. 2013). The aromatic components contained in PET caused this
synthetic polymer difficult to be degraded naturally in the environment (Webb et al. 2013).
The presence of ester bonds in PET polymers leads to their strong and recalcitrant characters
causing them scarcely to be degraded in the environment (Lucas et al. 2008, Khoironi et al. 2019).
However, many microbial communities can utilize PET as their carbon and energy source (Zhang
et al. 2004, Webb et al. 2013). Extracellular polymeric components produced and excreted by some
microbes are appropriate to overcome the recalcitrant properties of plastics including PET. Thus,
they can be used as plastic polymers degrading agents. Extracellular components produced by
microbes play an important role as bio surfactants that enhance the changing of hydrophilic and
hydrophobic phases between the plastic surface and microbial cell surfaces. This change is
important to help them to break down plastic polymers (Lucas et al. 2008, Khoironi et al. 2019).
Furthermore, biodegradable plastics and polymers are materials that are now widely used in
various industries (Weng et al. 2013, Kim et al. 2017). Biodegradable polymers are polymers
containing amides, esters, or ethers bonds. Biodegradable polymers can be distinguished into agropolymers, and bio-polyesters (Tiwari et al. 2018). Some biodegradable plastics include polylactic
acid (PLA) and polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (Weng et al. 2013, Kim et al. 2017).
Although biopolymers are easier to be degraded than non-biodegradable synthetic polymers,
biodegradable polymers also have strong carbon bonds that cannot be degraded in such a short time
(Tiwari et al. 2018). The complete biodegradation process of a biodegradable polymers in nature
takes months or even years (Kim et al. 2017).
The Negative Effects of Plastics Waste
The massive use of plastics generates the accumulation of plastic wastes in the environment
(Ahsan et al. 2016). Plastic wastes cause many diseases for living beings, including humans. Plastic
polymers accidentally ingested lead to immune system disorders, inhibit and disturb enzyme
activities, and cause hormonal system disorders resulting in abnormalities of the endocrine system.
The carcinogenic compounds of this synthetic polymer threaten many living creatures both on land
and in aquatic environments (Pavani & Rajeswari 2014, Munir et al. 2018).
Plastic waste polluting the land can be imperfectly degraded by environmental factors. They
cause the washing or decomposition of harmful substances of the plastic polymers into the
environment. Hazardous substances such as heavy metals, plasticizers, stabilizers, and plastic dyes
will be released into the environment. These pollutants pollute the terrestrial environment.
Furthermore, they will be carried by the water stream then pollute the aquatic environment. In
particular, around 80% of plastic pollution in the aquatic environment originated from the land
(Sheavly 2005, Alabi et al. 2019).
Plastic wastes float from one place to another. They might bring many living things to new
places, introduce some invasive species to a new aquatic environment that will compete with
indigenous species (Derraik 2002, Hasnat & Rahman 2018). Fire is another adverse effect of plastic
waste that is caused by the burning of flammable plastic waste. Not only causes many types of
losses, but the smoke produced by the burning of the plastic wastes also emits toxic gases into the
air like carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen monoxide (HCN) (Purwaningrum 2016).
Even though plastic might be degraded in nature after hundreds or thousands of years, the
incomplete degradation of that recalcitrant polymer releases toxic fragments into the environment
thus causing many problems. The fragmented toxic compounds might be accumulated in various
living things resulting in some health disorders (Kang et al. 2019). Moreover, the accumulation of
plastic wastes pollute the view which decreases the attractiveness of tourism objects in a country
thus adversely affecting a country's economy, mainly a country that is highly depend on tourism as
the main source of its GDP. It is because of the number of plastic wastes discomfort and reduce the
tourists interest toward a tourism object (UNEP 2018). After all, the complete and environmentally
safe plastic waste processing method is needed. Various studies have reported that the degradation
of plastic waste using enzymes produced by microbes such as fungi is the appropriate method to
overcome plastic pollution (Kang et al. 2019).

Plastics Waste Biodegradation
Plastic recycling activities have several weaknesses. Plastic wastes that piled up by the
community become more difficult to separate based on its type. It will be worse if the plastic
wastes mixed with various other wastes. The mixed plastic wastes will affect the plastic melting
point and even get more complicated. Contaminated plastic waste might damage the plastic melting
machine. Besides, adequate space is also needed in recycling (Sahwan et al. 2005).
The burning of plastic wastes as often done by the community, and incineration process
produce pollutants that are harmful to the environment. The incineration process releases
greenhouse gases such as furans and dioxins depleting the ozone layer. Dioxins are hazardous
components interfering with the endocrine system in humans (Chaturvedi 2002, Pilz et al. 2010,
Kumar et al. 2017). Therefore, biodegradation is the essential plastic wastes processing method to
solve these problems as this process will completely degrade plastic polymers resulting in
microbial biomass as its biological agents (Kumar et al. 2017).
Synthetic polymers are potential energy and carbon sources for microorganisms. For instance,
complete oxidation of polyethylene polymers produces almost the same energy as glucose, a
substrate for microbes. The complete oxidation of polyethylene produces usable energy ranging
from -422 kJ to -425 kJ per mole of O2. Meanwhile, the usable energy generated from glucose is
-479 Kj per mole O2. The complexity of synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and
polypropylene, containing C-C skeletal bonds, makes them nonhydrolyzable. As they are
nonhydrolyzable so they will be firstly broken down through redox reactions into simpler ones then
assimilated by microbial cells. Meanwhile, hydrolyzable polymers such as polyethylene
terephthalate and polyamide, containing amides and ester bonds, can be directly hydrated by
enzymes produced by microbes (Gewert et al. 2015, Krueger et al. 2015, Oberbeckmann & Labrenz
2020).
Hydrolysis is the breaking down of the functional bonds of a polymer by recombining them
with water (Tiwari et al. 2018). The hydrolysis of semi-crystalline polymers such as esters, amides,
and anhydrides take place in two stages. The first stage is the diffusion of water into the amorphous
with succeeding hydrolysis. The second step will begin when moisture penetrates and degrades the
crystalline parts of the polymer. The process will reduce the crystallinity and molecular weight of
the polymer which makes the polymer more easily dissolved in water thus increases the erosion rate
of the polymer. Afterward, the plastic surface corrosion process will change the structural
dimensions of the plastic polymer (Rabek 1975, Tiwari et al. 2018).
Biodegradation is a complete degradation process of a polymer through the activity of
enzymes produced by microorganisms. The biodegradation process of plastic wastes is the
breakdown of complex plastic polymers into simpler oligomers and monomers. These results will
then be absorbed into the microbial cells (Gu 2003, Muhonja et al. 2018). In biodegradation,
microbes will colonize the plastic surface to form biofilms. The colonization of plastic surfaces is
affected by the hydrophobicity compatibility of plastic surfaces and microbes. Biofilms on plastic
surfaces are useful for accelerating the degradation process of plastic polymers (Agrawal & Singh
2016). Furthermore, there are two main activities in the biodegradation process. The first activity is
the process of converting molecules that have high molecular weight into organic monomers and
organic acids that occur through biological and chemical hydrolysis. The second process is the
decomposition of these materials into gas that is carried out by microorganisms (Bikiaris 2013,
Kim et al. 2017).
Biodegradation has four stages consisting of biodeterioration, depolymerization, assimilation,
and mineralization (Gu 2003, Muhonja et al. 2018). Biodeterioration is the cooperation activities
between several microorganisms and abiotic factors that break down polymers into simpler ones.
Depolymerization is a process in which microorganisms secrete catalytic compounds in the form of
enzymes and free radicals to form biofilms helping them to break the polymer chain progressively
become oligomers, dimers, and monomers (Marjayandari & Shovitri 2015). During the
biodegradation process, the microbes expel various exoenzymes that break down complex
polymers into simpler compounds that have shorter chains. These results will be used as carbon and
4

energy sources for microorganisms, the process is called depolymerization (Frazer 1994, Nandi &
Joshi 2013).
Moreover, biodegradation also involves mineralization processes (Frazer 1994, Nandi &
Joshi 2013). This is a stage of biodegradation in which produces CO2, H2O, or CH4 (Premraj &
Doble 2005). Mineralization occurs through a series of biological activities (Kim et al. 2017).
Meanwhile, the degradation rate of plastic waste highly depends on the structure of the polymers
forming the plastic, although the differences of the plastic structures are not too distinct. Other
factors influencing the biodegradation of plastic waste are molecular weight, molecular shape, and
crystallinity of plastic polymers (Premraj & Doble 2005).
Plastics Degrading Fungi
Many studies have reported the ability of fungi in plastic biodegradation (Table 1). Using
fungi as bioremediation agents is an appropriate method to decrease the amount of plastic wastes
polluting the environment. The rapid growth of fungi in many substrates is a beneficial factor in
biodegradation. Because of their rapid growth, their mycelium will be spread out covering the
entire substrate surfaces then penetrating them to start the biodegradation process. Fungi can be
found in any kind of environment, including extreme environments such as low pH and arid (Kim
& Rhee 2003, Nandi & Joshi 2013). Fungi isolated from soil exposed to plastics are important
plastic wastes biodegradation agents (Nandi & Joshi 2013). There are many studies that reported
some plastic degrading fungi including Gliomastix sp., Chaetomium sp., Fusarium sp., Mortierella
sp., and Paecilomyces sp. (Nathania & Kuswytasari 2013, Hardiyanti et al. 2017). Indigenous fungi
isolated from plastics contaminated landfill are potential agents of plastic biodegradation as
Trichoderma sp., Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger (Hardiyanti et al. 2017).

There are many studies that reported polyethylene (PE) degrading fungi, Myceliophthora sp.
is one of them. This fungus produces laccase catalyzing the degrading process of plastic polymers.
It produces laccase optimally at pH 5.0 and temperature 30oC. This plastic degrading fungus can
grow on a medium containing polyethylene. Electron microscopy analysis showed that the surface
of the plastic exposed to the fungus was damaged, thus closely related to the activity of the laccase
produced by the fungus (Khalil et al. 2013).
Two other polyethylene degrading isolates are Aspergillus terreus MANGF1/WL and
Aspergillus sydowii PNPF15/TF isolated from the Avicennia marina rhizosphere. Aspergillus
terreus MANGF1/WL reduced 50% of the weight of plastic samples at pH 5.0 within 60 days.
Whereas Aspergillus sydowii PNPF15/TF reduced the weight of plastic samples about 94% at pH
3.5 within the same incubation period. These weight reductions were associated with depolymerase
enzyme activity that broke the polyethylene bonds (Sangale et al. 2019). As well as those fungi, A.
fumigatus reduced polyethylene weight about 24% and A. oryzae 36%. Fungi Aspergillus spp. such
as A. fumigatus, A. oryzae and A. flavus produce laccase to degrade plastic polymers. While the
highest laccase activity was found in A. oryzae (Muhonja et al. 2018).
Indumathi & Gayathri (2016), successfully obtained several plastic degrading fungi isolated
from plastic-contaminated dumping sites consisting of Aspergillus niger, A. oryzae, A. japonicus
and Penicillium sp. They found that A. oryzae dominated the soil samples. The fungus was then
tested for its plastic degradation ability using plastic strips that are buried in soil pits. Based on the
research, A. oryzae degraded those plastics about 20% within 15 days, 24% within 30 days, 26%

6

within 45%, and 30% within 60 days. SEM analysis revealed that the plastics were experiencing
micro cracks (Indumathi & Gayathri 2016).
Chaetomium globosum was also reported as a plastic degrading fungus. The degradation rate
of the fungus was higher after the plastic was given preliminary treatment by UV light and
autoclaved. It reduced the plastic weight exposed to UV light by about 21% within 3 months. UV
light is the oxidation initiator of polymers as well as accelerates the degradation rate. The initial
treatment using UV light in plastic degradation was more effective. The degradation of autoclaved
plastic using Chaetomium globosum was only 7.5%. Meanwhile, plastic samples that were only
surface sterilized before exposed to this fungus were degraded by about 5.6% within the same
incubation time (Sowmya et al. 2014). Aspergillus niger and A. flavus decreased the plastic weights
which were previously exposed by UV light and 99.9% nitric acid around 19-24% within 2-4
months (Nandi & Joshi 2013). Moreover, Fusarium sp. AF4 was also reported that it was able to
bind to the surface of PE. Based on the electron microscopy analysis, it was known that its hypha
damaged the plastic surface. It thus facilitated the biodegradation process carried out by Fusarium
sp. AF4 (Shah et al. 2009).
Alshehrei (2017), obtained LDPE plastic degrading fungi isolated from the Red Sea including
Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. terreus, A. fumigatus and Penicillium sp. The percentage of weight
loss of the plastic samples within 1 month exposed to A. niger was 19.5%, A. flavus 16.2%,
A. terreus 21.8%, A. fumigatus 20.5%, and Penicillium sp. was 43.3% (Alshehrei 2017).
Aspergillus japonicas degraded the plastic about 12% within the same incubation period. SEM
analysis proved that the plastic surfaces were experienced cracking, corrosion, and folding
compared to controls that seemed normal (Mandan & Arya 2017). Also, Mucor sp. isolated from
soil exposed to polyethylene plastic degraded LDPE about 16% within 4 weeks incubation in
synthetic media containing LDPE as the main carbon source (Singh & Gupta 2014). Still, there are
many LDPE degrading fungi such as Alternaria alternate, Emericella nidulans, Paecilomyces
variotii, Penicillium duclauxii and P. vinaceum (Ameen et al. 2015).
Aspergillus fumigatus also has a high HDPE plastic degradation ability. The fungus was able
to reduce 59% of the plastic sample’s weight, 60.4 mg to 33.6 mg, using soil media within 9
months. Whereas in the liquid medium, within 2 months it reduced HDPE weight about 29.1%.
Based on SEM analysis, plastic surfaces tested with soil medium suffered more damages and
perforations than liquid media compared to controls that were not damaged. FTIR analysis detected
the presence of functional groups from the degradation process such as ketones, aldehydes,
carboxylic acids, and others (Verma & Gupta 2019). Bjerkandera adusta was also reported to be
able to degrade HDPE. The fungus produces oxidative extracellular enzymes potentially as plastic
degrading enzymes. Raman analysis illustrated that the enzymes produced by the fungus degraded
the amorphous structure of the HDPE (Kang et al. 2019).
Meanwhile, A. niger (Ingavale et al. 2018), Penicillium oxalicum NS4 (KU559906) and
P. chrysogenum NS10 (KU559907) degraded both LDPE and HDPE (Ojha et al. 2017, Verma &
Gupta 2019). The degradation of LDPE and HDPE by A. niger was characterized by the decreasing
in plastic molecular weight, plastic thickness, and intensity of the functional plastic groups. The
color of the plastic samples exposed to the fungus was faded as well as the surface was damaged.
These were the signs of enzymatic activity carried out by A. niger. In particular, the weight
reduction of LDPE by the submerged method was 3.97% and the composting method was 1.89%.
Whereas the weight reduction of HDPE with the submerged method was 3.56% and 1.6% with the
composting method within 60 days (Ingavale et al. 2018). Not only degraded polyethylene
polymers but A. niger also degraded another polymer, PET. Within 1 month this fungus was
reported to decrease 52.94% of PET weight in Rose Bengal Broth (Asmita et al. 2015).
Some fungi known as PHB plastic degradation agents are Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium,
Alternaria, Trichoderma, A. fumagates, A. oryzae (Aburas 2016), and Trichoderma viride (Râpă et
al. 2014). The percentage of PHB degradation using solid media containing PHB within 7 days by
Alternaria alternate was 14%, Aspergillus flavus 23%, Aspergillus fumigatus 24%, Aspergillus
nidulans 47%, Aspergillus niger 24%, A. ochraceus 24%, Aspergillus parasiticus 25%, A. terreus
7

29%, Fusarium sp. 34%, Penicillium sp. 34% and Trichoderma sp. 14%. The hydrolysis of the
PHB polymers catalyzed by depolymerase enzymes produced by those fungi (Aburas 2016).
Meanwhile, Trichoderma viride caused several changes in plastic samples after 10 days of
incubation including change in the color of plastic, perforation, and damage of the plastic surface.
The surface perforation is the initial stage carried out by fungi before their mycelium covering the
entire surface of the plastic then breaking down the plastic polymer (Râpă et al. 2014).
Polyurethane plastic (PUR) can be degraded by several fungi including Monascus
sanguineus, Monascus sp. (El-Morsy et al. 2017), and Pestalotiopsis microspore (Mandan & Arya
2017). Monascus spp. produce esterase, protease, and lipase that catalyze the degradation of
polyurethane by breaking down the ester bonds of PUR (El-Morsy et al. 2017). Besides being able
to produce various kinds of antibiotic compounds, endophytic fungi are also reported to be able to
degrade plastics. Lii et al. (2017) reported that Pestalotiopsis isolated from Nephentes ampullaria
was able to degrade polyurethane (PUR). This endophytic fungus used PUR as its carbon source.
The PUR degradation activity correlated with the activity of the esterase. Also, it was suspected
that there was the involvement of the metallothionein-like protein in the degradation of the PUR
(Lii et al. 2017). Pestalotiopsis microspore produces serine hydrolase enzymes and polyurethanase
enzymes induced when the fungus is in a media containing PUR. It is also able to degrade plastics
in anaerobic conditions which are very important for plastic waste degradation in extreme
environments (Mandan & Arya 2017).
Polyester-polyurethane (PS-PUR) degrading fungi including Spicaria spp., Aspergillus
sonali, A. terreus, A. flavus, A. fumigatus and Fusarium solani used this polymer as their carbon
and nitrogen source. In liquid shaking culture using liquid basal media within 3 weeks of
incubation, Fusarium solani degraded completely (100%) the plastic sample. Meanwhile, under the
same condition, the plastic degradation by Spicaria spp. was 12.7%, Aspergillus sonali 71.8%, A.
terreus 26.1%, A. flavus 40.5%, and A. fumigatus 43.5%. In solid basal medium for 3 weeks
incubation, Fusarium solani decreased that plastic weight by about 72.5%, Spicaria spp. degraded
it about 22.9%. While, the percentage of degradation by A. solani, A. tereus, A. flavus, and A.
fumigatus were 63.6%, 58%, 98.4% and 39.5% (Ibrahim et al. 2011).
Besides being able to be used as biodegradation agents for plastic waste on the land, fungi
can also be used as agents for the degradation of plastic waste in the aquatic environment. Paço et
al. (2017) reported that fungi found in the sea, Zalerion maritimum, degraded PE polymer (Drzyzga
& Prieto 2018).
Enzymes Involved in Plastics Biodegradation
During the biodegradation process, the fungal mycelium covers the entire plastic surfaces.
They will synthesize and release various enzymes, such as lipase, esterase, urease, depolymerase,
and hydrolase to break down the plastic polymers (Râpă et al. 2014). The ability of fungi to
produce enzymes is influenced by the used substrate. The type of enzyme produced by fungi
depends on the substrate. In particular, the differences between plastic polymers cause different
types of enzymes produced by fungi. For instance, in the degradation of polyurethane, fungi will
release some important enzymes to breakdown that plastic polymers such as proteases, esterases,
lipases, laccases, and polyurethanases (Ibrahim et al. 2011, El-Morsy et al. 2017). These enzymes
will break down polyurethane polymers by breaking the ester bonds (Bhardwaj et al. 2011, ElMorsy et al. 2017).
Aspergillus flavus is one of many fungi known to be able to produce laccase, amylase, lignin
peroxidase, and manganese peroxidase. Aspergillus niger produces laccase, lignin peroxidase, and
manganese peroxidase. Fusarium graminearum produces amylase, laccase, lignin peroxidase, and
manganese peroxidase. These four types of enzymes are essential in the breaking down of carbon
bonds in polyethylene polymers (Ganesh et al. 2017). Meanwhile, Pestalotiopsis microspore
produces serine hydrolase enzyme which catalyzes the degradation of PUR polymers (Russell et al.
2011, Lii et al. 2017).

Not only useful in producing secondary metabolites but endophytic fungi also useful in
plastic biodegradation. One of the plastic degrading endophytic fungi is Pestalotiopsis microspora.
This fungus is a polyurethane plastic degrading agent. It produces serine hydrolase. This fungus
also produces polyurethanase which is induced when the fungus is in a medium containing PUR.
The fungus can degrade plastics in anaerobic condition, thus it is very important for processing
plastic waste in extreme environments (Mandan & Arya 2017). Meanwhile, the degradation of PE
by Chaetomium globosum catalyzed by laccase and manganese peroxidase. Manganese peroxidase
activity is higher compared to laccase in the biodegradation process by this fungus (Sowmya et al.
2014).
Plastic polymers will be degraded through two steps. The first step is the release of enzymes
into the substrate, the plastic polymers. The enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis reaction of the plastic
polymers. Extracellular and intracellular depolymerase enzymes degrade plastic polymers. The
smaller parts resulted from the early degradations will be absorbed by microbes which will then
undergo intracellular biodegradation processes (Tokiwa & Calabia 2004, Bhardwaj et al. 2012).
Hydrolase is a class of enzymes that has broad substrates that catalyze hydrolysis reaction of
many substrates including peptides, amides, and halides (Junge & Kirsch 1973, Fojan et al. 2000).
The hydrolysis of a polymer is conducted by involving aspartate, histidine, and serine. Interaction
between aspartate and histidine ring produces hydrogen bonds. Histidine deprotonating serine
forms nucleophilic alkoxide (-O) which attacks ester bonds in plastic polymers. This reaction
produces an alcoholic tip and an acyl-enzyme complex. The acyl-enzyme complex will be attacked
by water forming a carboxyl-end and free enzyme (Lucas et al. 2008, Tiwari et al. 2018).
Two examples of hydrolase enzymes are esterase and lipase (Fojan et al. 2000). Esterase is an
enzyme classified into hydrolase which catalyzes the breaking down and formation of ester bonds,
involved in interesterification, intraesterification, and transesterification (Sayali et al. 2013). Ester
bonds forming many polymers such as polyesters can be degraded by the esterase (Premraj &
Doble 2005). This enzyme is often found in many microorganisms (Premraj & Doble 2005)
including fungi such as Monascus ruber (El-Morsy et al. 2017).
Lipase is also categorized as a hydrolase enzyme which has broad substrates. Lipase catalyzes
water-insoluble substrates like long-chain fatty acids (Verger 1997, Fojan et al. 2000). Lipase is
also capable of catalyzing hydrolytic cleavage of the ester bonds found in polyester that has a low
molecular weight (Premraj & Doble 2005). Enzymes such as lipases and PHA depolymerases break
ester bonds found in aliphatic polyester including PLA. Before the hydrolysis reaction occurs
toward the polymers, the hydrophobic side of the enzyme will bind to the solid substrate through
hydrophobic interactions (Mochizuki & Hirami 1997, Prema & Palempalli 2015). The optimum
activity of PLA depolymerase isolated from Bacillus licheneformis was at pH 7.0, while the
optimum temperature was around of 50oC-60oC. Heavy metals such as Mn2+, Cu2+, Na+, K+, Mg2+,
and Fe2+ are the inhibitors of this enzyme (Prema & Palempalli 2015).
Another important enzyme involved in plastic biodegradation is laccase. Laccase is an
enzyme widely found in plants, fungi, other microorganisms (Sivakumar et al. 2010, Khalil et al.
2013) and insects (Dana et al. 2017). This enzyme catalyzes the phenol substrate and other similar
molecules through the oxidation process. This enzyme is a common lignolytic and lignin-degrading
enzyme (Sivakumar et al. 2010, Khalil et al. 2013).
Laccase is a polyphenol oxidase that oxidizes lignin by using molecular oxygen and
producing water as its product. Laccase has broad substrates including phenols, ortho- and paradiphenols, amino phenols, methoxy phenols, polyphenols, polyamines, aryl diamines, and
ascorbate. Laccase has various benefits, one of which is in the field of plastic bioremediation (Dana
et al. 2017). This enzyme degrades xenobiotics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAs),
phenolic components, chlorinated phenolic pollutants, and diesel (Pannu & Kapoor 2014,
Zarinkamar et al. 2014, Dana et al. 2017). This indicates great potential for environmental
management caused by plastic wastes pollution (Gianfreda et al. 1999, Khalil et al. 2013).
Laccase catalyzes the breaking down of polyethylene to carboxylic acid through oxidation.
The product will be transported to fl-oxidation with coenzyme-A which breaks two carboxylic acid
9

fragments into acetyl-SCoA which will be further metabolized through the citric acid cycle. Water
and carbon dioxide will be produced at the end of that reaction (Khalil et al. 2013). Multigene
families associated with laccase production are mostly found in fungi. 17 genes that encode laccase
production found in Coprinopsis cinera (Lu et al. 2015, Dana et al. 2017). Fungal laccase is a blue
enzyme that contains multicopper. It catalyzes the oxidation of one electron contained in the phenol
components by reducing molecular oxygen into water (Reinhammar 1984, Nishida et al. 2001).
Other important enzymes are PHA depolymerases, PHB depolymerases, PLA depolymerases,
PCL depolymerases, cutinases, ureases, proteinases (proteinase K in PLA degradation), and
dehydratases (Pathak & Navneet 2017, Urbanek et al. 2018). PHA and PHB can be degraded by
PHA and PHB depolymerases. PHB depolymerases degrade all (R) chains, cyclic-(R) oligomers,
oligolides, and polymers composed of racemic hydroxybutanoate (Shimao 2001, Premraj & Doble
2005). PCL can be degraded by lipases, esterases, cutinases (Premraj & Doble 2005). PLA
degraded by Proteinase K, pronase, and bromelain (Shimao 2001, Premraj & Doble 2005). The
ability of proteases to degrade PLA is because they can recognize α-ester bonds found in PLA
(Nakamura et al. 2001, Pranamuda et al. 2001, Jarerat et al. 2006, Panyachanakul et al. 2019).
Meanwhile, polyurethane polymers can be degraded by proteases, esterases, lipases, laccases, and
polyurethanases (Ibrahim et al. 2011, El-Morsy et al. 2017).
Conclusions and Future Perspective
Plastics biodegradation using fungi is considered a potential method in overcoming the
problem of plastic wastes. It is safe and more environmentally friendly. Fungi produce various kinds
of extracellular and intracellular enzymes that degrade plastic polymers. Fungi use plastic polymers
as energy and carbon sources for their metabolism. The application of this method can be crucial to
overcome the accumulation of plastic wastes.
However, the biodegradation of plastic waste has certain limitations. The plastics
biodegradation process is affected by biotic factors, bioavailability, and characteristics of plastic
polymers. Abiotic factors that affect the rate of plastic biodegradation are moisture, temperature, and
pH. Biotic factors determining the rate of plastic biodegradation are enzymes and hydrophobicity.
Meanwhile, the characteristics of plastic polymers that affect biodegradation are molecular weight,
size and shape, additives, and bio surfactants (Ahmed et al. 2018). The type of fungus used also
affects the biodegradation process of plastic waste. Each fungus is only effective in degrading
certain types of plastic waste. This limitation is related to its ability to produce suitable enzymes to
decompose plastic waste.
Additionally, the studies of plastics biodegradation still focus on a laboratory scale and macro
plastic waste. Also, based on the reported researches, the biodegradation rate of plastic waste using
microorganisms takes ages (Matjašič et al. 2020). Therefore, research and development regarding
the ability of fungi to degrade plastic wastes need to be conducted in future. Understanding fungal
metabolism in degrading plastic wastes is one of the main factors. Metabolic engineering and
optimization of processes are also essential to increase the fungal ability to degrade plastic wastes.
