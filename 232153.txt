Munuru Srikanth1, T. S. R. S. Sandeep1* , Kuvala Sucharitha2 and Sudhakar Godi3

Abstract
Plastic polymers are non-degradable solid wastes that have become a great threat to the whole world and degradation of these plastics would take a few decades. Compared with other degradation processes, the biodegradation
process is the most effective and best way for plastic degradation due to its non-polluting mechanism, eco-friendly
nature, and cost-effectiveness. Biodegradation of synthetic plastics is a very slow process that also involves environmental factors and the action of wild microbial species. In this plastic biodegradation, fungi play a pivotal role, it acts
on plastics by secreting some degrading enzymes, i.e., cutinase`, lipase, and proteases, lignocellulolytic enzymes,
and also the presence of some pro-oxidant ions can cause effective degradation. The oxidation or hydrolysis by the
enzyme creates functional groups that improve the hydrophilicity of polymers, and consequently degrade the high
molecular weight polymer into low molecular weight. This leads to the degradation of plastics within a few days.
Some well-known species which show effective degradation on plastics are Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus flavus,
Aspergillus glaucus, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus nomius, Penicillium griseofulvum, Bjerkandera adusta, Phanerochaete
chrysosporium, Cladosporium cladosporioides, etc., and some other saprotrophic fungi, such as Pleurotus abalones,
Pleurotus ostreatus, Agaricus bisporus and Pleurotus eryngii which also helps in degradation of plastics by growing on
them. Some studies say that the degradation of plastics was more effective when photodegradation and thermooxidative mechanisms involved with the biodegradation simultaneously can make the degradation faster and easier.
This present review gives current knowledge regarding different species of fungi that are involved in the degradation
of plastics by their different enzymatic mechanisms to degrade different forms of plastic polymers.

Introduction
Plastic is considered as one of the threatful elements in
the environment because of its slow degradation in the
environment which seriously takes some decades, so it’s
considered a non-degrading material. These non-degradable plastics accumulated considered as solid waste on
the earth’s surface which is assumed as food by terrestrial animals, such as cows, buffaloes, and consuming it
which causes the death of animals (Singh 2005). These
plastics which form particulate matter by UV irradiation

and weathering increase surface area and mobility and,
therefore, easily incorporate into the food chain causing
serious effects to all the living organisms (Bonhomme
et al. 2003; Sen and Raut 2015). Disposing of the plastic
waste in oceans leads accumulation of toxic chemicals,
such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB’s), nonylphenol
(NP), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polybrominated diphenyl esters (PBDE), and bisphenol A (BPA) (Bryant et al.
2016), which have been found as a serious problem of
indigestion, gastrointestinal blockages and reproductive
problems in marine organisms. Due to this plastic pollution in the marine environment minimum of 267 species
are being affected which includes sea turtles (86%) and
seabirds (44%) (Coe et al. 1997). The worldwide annual

production of non-degradable plastic ranges from 350
to 400 million tons out of that yearly 5–13 million tons
of waste plastic are released into oceans which damages
the ecological environment. They are various forms of
plastics, i.e., nylon, polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyurethane, and polyvinyl chloride
(Usha et al. 2011). To degrade these plastics, there are
different methods, such as photodegradation, thermooxidative degradation, hydrolytic degradation, and biodegradation. Photodegradation and thermo-oxidation
are categorized under abiotic degradation, whereas biotic
degradation involves the action of microbes. Photodegradation involves continuous exposure of UV light from
the sun or artificial source on plastic material which
eventually incorporates oxygen molecules in between
the structure which leads to breaking the complex polymers into simple molecules, while thermo-oxidative
involves exposure of heat on the plastic polymers (Geweret et al. 2015). However, exposure to high temperatures leads burning of plastic produces toxic gases into
the environment and poses health hazards by causing
lung diseases and cancer after inhalation (Pramila and
Vijaya Ramesh 2011). Compared with other degradations, the biodegradation method is mostly preferred
due to its pollution-free mechanism and eco-friendly
process. In biodegradation, the process is initiated by
micro-organisms, i.e., bacteria and fungi. In general, this
biodegradation of plastics involves the growth of fungi
on the surface of plastic, where plastic is consumed as
a food source by the fungi under the influence of environmental factors, such as temperature and pH. These
fungi will secrete enzymes, such as cutinase, lipase, and
proteases, carboxylesterases, esterases, lignocellulolytic
enzymes, and some pro-oxidant ions which will degrade
the plastics. By oxidation/hydrolysis enzyme improves
the hydrophilicity of polymers and consequently degrade
the high molecular weight polymer into low molecular
weight. As high molecular weight is a large compound
that cannot be transported across the cellular membrane
of the fungi thus it primarily depolymerizes it into small
monomers before they cross the cell membrane (Shah
et al. 2008). The enzyme activity is mainly dependent on
the solvent properties and the enzyme activity increases
with polarity and decreases with the viscosity of the solvent in the biodegradation of polymers (Patel et al. 2013).
The process becomes more effective when photodegradation and thermo-oxidative degradation is followed
by biodegradation, because as by photodegradation and
thermo-oxidative degradation, the plastic debris will be
broken-down from complex to simple material so biodegradation on such material will be easy and does not
require much time. Even practicing different methods,

plastic degradation takes sufficient time to complete
the process. The best solution for decreasing this plastic
pollution is using biodegradable plastics. These biodegradable polymers are designed to degrade quickly by
the microbes due to their ability to degrade organic and
inorganic materials, such as lignin, starch, cellulose, and
hemicelluloses (Kumar et al. 2013). In this review, we
described various fungi involved in the biodegradation
of different types of plastic polymers and summarized
recent studies on enzymes that are produced by various
fungi for the biodegradation of plastics. In additional, we
discussed the effective degradation of fungi on selective
plastics and plastic degradation by edible fungi.
Enzymes that involve in plastic degradation
Cutinases

Cutinases are a subclass of esterase enzyme which is identified by their ability to hydrolyze polyesters with high
molar mass (Chen et al. 2013). They are α/β hydrolases or
carboxylic ester hydrolases which were observed in plant
pathogenic fungi, i.e., Fusarium solani pisi (Kolattukudy
and Brown 1975; Kolattukudy et al. 1981; Heredia 2003).
Cutinases are produced by Fusarium solani (AlischMark et al. 2006; O’Neill et al. 2007), Penicillium citrinum (Liebminger et al. 2007), Pichia pastoris (Munari
2019) Aspergillus oryzae, Humicola insolens. The activities of Fusarium solani pisi cutinase (FsC) and Humicola insolens cutinase (HiC) were shown to be capable
of degrading low crystallinity PET film with 97% weight
loss being observed within 96 h (Ronqvist et al. 2009).
PET-hydrolases belong to the cutinases group which also
has promising results in the biodegradation of PET. An
enzyme that is similar to cutinase in function, i.e., isolated from Cryptococcus sp. Strain S-2 was identified for
its effective degradation of high molecular weight plastic,
i.e., polylactic acid (PLA) based plastic (Gemeren et al.
1998). Cutinase 2p from Arxula adeninivorans showed
enzymatic decomposition (hydrolysis/oxidation) of electrospun polycaprolactone fiber mats (Furukawa et al.
2019).
Lipases

Lipases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of lipids
they are also the subclass of esterases enzyme. Some fungal species that are well known to produce lipases and
are involved in the degradation of plastics, i.e., Rhizopus
delemer, Candida antarctica (Vertommen et al. 2005),
Thermomyces lanuginosus (Eberl et al. 2009), Candida
rugosa were degrading poly (butylene succinate-cohexamethylene succinate) copolymer. (Pereira et al.
2001). Rhizopus delemer lipase degraded 53% of the
polyester type-polyurethanes (ES-PU) film after 24 h
reaction (Tokiwa and Calabia 2009). A lipase enzyme

Srikanth et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing

(2022) 9:42

extracted from the yeast Cryptococcus sp, exhibited
hydrolysis of polybutylene succinate (PBS) and polybutylene succinate-co-adipate (PBSA) (Thirunavukarasua
et al. 2008). Lipase B from Candida antarctica was effectively hydrolyzing PET to TPA (Carniel et al. 2017), lipase
FE-01 from Thermomyces languinosus showed enzymatic
decomposition of electrospun polycaprolactone fiber
(Furukawa et al. 2019).
Proteases

Proteases are enzymes that cleave the long peptide chain
to short peptides or break down proteins to polypeptide
chains by hydrolysis this process is termed to be proteolysis. Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Paecelomyces, Penicillium,
Alternaria, Fusarium (Loredo-Treviño et al. 2011; Cosgrove et al. 2007), Phaenarochete (Shimao 2001), Pestalotiopsis (Russell 2011) Rhizopus, Mucor, Humicola,
Thermoascus, Thermomyces (Souza et al. 2015) are some
of the important fungal species which are producing proteases to degrade plastics. Anthrobotrys oligospora synthesis serine protease that can degrade polylactic acid
(Ozsagiroglu et al. 2012).
Esterases

Esterases are hydrolase enzymes that split esters into
alcohols and acids by the addition of water molecules.
Esterases are also involved in plastic degradation
which is produced by both bacteria and fungi, esterase
from Comamonas acidovorans is helpful in the degradation of low molecular weight PLA (plastic obtained
from renewable resources). Purpureocillium lilacinum and Curvularia senegalensis are a group of fungi
that degrade poly (butylene succinate-co-adipate) and
polyurethane (Yamamoto-Tamura et al. 2015). Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus tubingensis are assumed that they
secrete esterases that are responsible for the degradation
of plastics (Khan et al. 2017; Tokiwa et al. 2009). Esterase, derived from Xepiculopsis graminea, and Penicillium
griseofulvum reported degrading polyurethane (Brunner
et al. 2018). Lipase and esterase also degrade polycaprolactone polymers (Ganesh et al. 2017).
Laccase

Laccases are multi-copper oxidases that catalyze the
oxidation of phenolic compounds. It utilizes molecular
oxygen as a co-substrate and produces water and byproducts (Nunes and Kunamneni 2018). The special ability of these laccases is they oxidize lignin so they involve
in degrading lignin (Osma et al. 2010). Laccase can also
involve in the oxidation of the hydrocarbon backbone
of polyethylene (Sivan 2011). Cochliobolus sp., a specific fungus that is degrading PVC by laccases (Sumathi

Page 3 of 10

et al. 2016). Bjerkandera adusta TBB-03 was identified
for its ability to degrade HDPE under lignocellulose substrate treatment by laccase production (Bo Ram Kang
2019). Trametes versicolor, Pleurotus ostreatus, Streptomyces, P. ostreatus and T. pubescens produce laccase that
degrades polyethylene (Osma et al. 2010). In general, the
Ligninolytic enzyme families include phenol oxidase (laccase), heme peroxidases, lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP), and versatile peroxidase (VP)
(Dashtban et al. 2010). Papain and urease are the two proteolytic enzymes that were found to degrade medical polyester polyurethane by hydrolysis of urethane and urea
linkages by producing free amine and hydroxyl groups
(Phua et al. 1987). Penicillium-derived laccase potentially
involves in PE breakdown (Abd El-Rehim et al. 2004).
Peroxidases

Peroxidases are enzymes that fall under the oxidoreductase class which catalyzes oxidation–reduction reactions
by the action of free radicals on compounds to form oxidized and polymerized compounds. They are also called
catalases; peroxidases of fungi are regarded to be more
efficient in converting lignin. This class includes lignin
peroxidases (LiP), manganese peroxidases (MnP), and
versatile peroxidases (VP) which are mostly found in
white-rot fungi (Hofrichter and Ullrich 2006). Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and Trametes versicolor showed
effective degradation of high-molecular-weight polyethylene, where MnP/Manganese peroxidases is the
key enzyme in polyethylene degradation (Iiyoshi et al.
1998). Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Pleurotus ostreatus and S22 showed a high capacity for lignin degradation at pH 9.0–11. Ligninolytic enzymes, includes LiP,
MnP, and laccase (Wu et al. 2005). Fusarium graminearum showed polyethylene degradation by producing peroxidase (Ganesh et al. 2017). Aspergillus flavus,
Aspergillus niger, and Fusarium graminearum produce
manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase and these
enzymes induce the biodegradation of PCB (polyethylene carry bag). The maximum range of lignin peroxides
are produced in Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus
(Bholay et al. 2012).
Pro‑oxidant ions

Pro-oxidant ions are chemical elements that induce oxidative stress by releasing reactive oxygen species or by
inhibiting the antioxidant system. These elements can be
as transition metals, such as Fe, Co (Weiland et al. 1995),
and Mn (Jakubowicz 2003), and can enhance the photoand thermo-oxidation, PE chains may lead to radical
reactions that lead to cleavage in polymer chains (Koutny
et al. 2006). The pro-oxidants are transient metal ions,

Srikanth et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing

(2022) 9:42

added in form of stearate or other organic ligand complexes, mostly stearates of ­Fe3+, ­Mn2+ (Jakubowicz 2003),
or ­Co2+ (Weiland et al. 1995). ­Fe3+ complex involves in
the photo-oxidation process as a source of radicals for
reaction initiation, the M
­ n2+ or ­Co2 is necessary for oxidation without the influence of light, when they catalyze
the decomposition of peroxides associated with chain
cleavage. It was identified that trace amounts of metals
such as Co, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Ni showed increasing the
rate of oxidation (Gorghiu et al. 2004), these facilitate
cleavage of molecules into smaller fragments containing hydrophilic oxygenated groups that can be easily
degraded by microbes (Shang et al. 2003).
Enzymatic mechanisms involved in plastic biodegradation
by fungi

The mechanism of biodegradation involves the action
of microbial enzymes on the surface of the plastics. The
microbes such as bacteria and fungi attach to the plastic film and inert the enzymes and grow on it by utilizing it as substrate and source of nutrition. Therefore,
the polymers slowly get depolymerized and degradation
will be compiled by mineralization process, where H
­ 2O
(water), ­CO2 (carbon dioxide), ­CH2 (methane) are end
products (Frazer 1994; Montazer et al. 2019). The ability
of fungi was they can invade substrates using enzymes
that can detoxify pollutants. Fungi can also produce
some surface-active proteins, i.e., hydrophobins to coat
hyphae to hydrophobic substrates. The growth of many
fungi can also cause small-scale swelling and bursting,
as the fungi penetrate the polymer solids (Griffin 1980).
The degradation of plastics by some fungi occurs through
the intracellular and extracellular enzymatic systems.
The intracellular enzymatic system acts as an internal
mechanism for detoxification and plays a major role in
fungal adaption (Jeon et al. 2016; Olicón-Hernández et al.
2017; Schwartz et al. 2018; Shin et al. 2018). This system is mediated by the cytochrome P450 family (CYP),
Phase I enzyme epoxidase and, Phase II enzyme transferases which involve oxidation and conjugation reactions. Cytochrome P450 family are heme-containing
mono-oxygenases that are involved in catalyzing various
enzymatic reactions (Shin et al. 2018). Cytochrome P450
enzymes are important for primary metabolism, enabling
protection of the hyphal wall integrity and the formation
of the spore outer wall (Črešnar and Petrič 2011). CYP
isoforms are anchored in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, having their active sites connected to
both the cytosolic and membrane environments so they
can uptake substrate from both surroundings (Šrejber
et al. 2018). CYP contains three cofactors ­(NADPH+, ­H+,
FAD, and Heme) and two enzymes (NADPH: CYP reductase and cytochrome P-450 hydrolase). The extracellular

Page 4 of 10

enzymatic system consists of a hydrolytic system that
produces hydrolases that are involved in polysaccharide
degradation and the unspecific oxidative system involved
in breaking down complex structures, such as lignin degradation (Sánchez 2009). The unspecific oxidative system
can oxidize a wide range of substrates. It is formed mainly
by nonspecific oxidoreductases, including enzymes, such
as class II peroxidases (manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, and versatile peroxidase), laccases, and unspecific peroxygenases. These enzymes transfer electrons
from organic substrates to molecular oxygen (laccases)
by oxidation–reduction reactions using H
­ 2O2 as an electron-accepting co-substrate or by epoxidation, aromatic
preoxygenation, and sulfoxidation (Karich et al. 2017).
This enzymatic complex is produced mainly by wooddegrading fungi, such as basidiomycetes (Sánchez 2009).
The action of fungi on the surface of plastics can be
affected by environmental factors such as moisture, pH,
temperature, etc. sufficient moisture is required for activation of fungi, appropriate pH environment is required
for the action of enzymes on plastic polymer and equally,
temperature plays a vital role in this biodegradation process, polymers of high melting point take more time to
degrade than polymers of low melting point (Fig. 1).
Aerobic and anaerobic plastic biodegradation

In aerobic biodegradation, the degradation involves in
presence of oxygen which is also known as aerobic respiration. Aerobic fungi use oxygen as an electron acceptor, and breakdown complex organic compounds into
smaller organic compounds often producing co2 and
water as end products (Seymour et al. 1899), formation of
carbon dioxide (Sturm test) are good indicators for polymer degradation and are the most often used methods
to measure biodegradation in laboratory tests. Anaerobic degradation occurs in absence of oxygen. Degradation of complex polymers into smaller units by microbes
with ­CH2, ­CO2, ­H2O, and biomass as their by-products.

simple polymer chains by action of fungi (biodegradation)

Srikanth et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing

(2022) 9:42

Anaerobic fungi in the absence of oxygen utilize other
sources as their electron acceptor, such as sulfate, nitrate,
iron, manganese, and carbon dioxide for biodegradation
(Alshehrei 2017). Two Pestalotiopsis microspora isolates
were observed to grow on PUR as the sole carbon source
under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, effective degradation activity was observed under anaerobic
growth using PUR (Jonathan and Russell 2011).
Biodegradation of various plastics

Polythene is mostly used plastics in daily life due to its
easy processing for products, such as plastic bags, plastic films, packing food materials, textiles (Arutchelvi et al.
2021). Polyethylene is chemically represented as ­(C2H4)
n. PE is a combination of polymers of ethylene with different values of n. They are low-density polyethylene and
high-density polyethylene. Low-density polyethylene is
processed by applying high pressure (1000–5000 atm)
and high temperature (520 kelvins), whereas high-density
polyethylene requires low pressure (6–7 atm) and low
temperature (333–343 K) (Lee et al. 1991). It is reported
that Polyethylene constitutes 64% of total synthetic plastics as it is been used for manufacturing bottles, carry
bags, disposable articles, garbage containers, margarine
tubs, milk jugs, and water pipes. Annually 500 billion to
1 trillion polythene bags are being used daily all over the
world. The usage of polythene is increased at a rate of
12% annum and approximately 140 million tonnes of synthetic plastic polymers are produced worldwide annually
(Roy et al. 2008). Phanerochaete chrysosporium is fungal
species that degrade high molecular weight polyethylene
under nitrogen-limited and carbon-limited conditions
(Shimao 2001). Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Fusarium,
Penicillium, Phanerochaete have been reported for polyethylene degradation (Danso et al. 2019; Glaser 2019;
Restrepo-Florez et al. 2014). Additives free Polyethylene
degradation was identified in Pencillium. simplicissimum (Esmaeili et al. 2013), Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus
japonicas and Fusarium. sp (Raaman et al. 2012). Penicillium chrysogenum NS10 (KU559907), Penicillium
oxalicum NS4 (KU559906) were identified for degrading
HDPE and LDPE (Ojha et al. 2017).
Polyethylene terephthalate/PET

Polyethylene terephthalate is a semicrystalline, thermoplastic, strong and durable, chemically and thermally
stable, has low gas permeability, and is easily processed.
PET is used as fibers, sheets and films, electronics,
automotive parts, houseware, lighting products, power
tools, sports goods, photographic applications, X-ray
sheets and textiles, and in food and beverage packaging (especially, soft-drink and water bottles) (Awaja and
Pavel 2005; Kint and Muñoz-Guerra 1999; Levchik and

Page 5 of 10

Weil 2004; Bergeret et al. 2009). Polyethylene and polypropylene represent about 92% of the synthetic plastics
produced, and they are used for the production of plastic
bags, disposable containers, bottles, packaging materials,
etc. (Byuntae et al. 1991). The enzymes involved in the
degradation (e.g., PET hydrolase and tannase, MHETase)
are typical serine hydrolases, such as cutinases, lipases,
and carboxylesterases (Wei et al. 2014). Fungal cutinases
of Fusarium and Humicola were identified for their degradation in PET. Even lipase CalB from Candida antarctica was also used in the PET degradation process
(Carniel et al. 2017). Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp., and
Fusarium sp are used as biological agents to degrade PET
and PS foam (Umamaheswari and Murali 2013). Aspergillus oryzae, C. antarctica, and Penicillium citrinum are
among other fungal enzymes that have been investigated
for activity on PET (Zimmermann and Billig 2010; Kawai
et al. 2019).
Polypropylene/PP

Polypropylene is also referred to as polypropene, a thermoplastic polymer. Polypropylene belongs to partially
crystalline polyolefins, mostly used polypropylene is isotactic. PP is used in manufacturing rugs, mats, carpets,
ropes, and chairs. It is also used in manufacturing laboratory-required equipment, such as wash bottles, centrifuge tubes, Eppendorf tubes, tips for pipettes, etc. The
surfaces of polypropylene are hydrophobic, because it has
CH and CH2 groups along its backbone and a ­CH3 pendant group. To make the polymer surface more hydrophilic, pre-treatments such as UV radiation, gamma
sterilization, or thermal treatments are followed (Koutny
et al. 2006; Halina et al. 2005; Alariqi et al. 2006). Bjerkandera adusta (Butnaru et al. 2016), Lasiodiplodia
theobromae (SanaSheik et al. November 2015), Coriolus
versicolor, (Kord et al. 2021) fungi are identified for their
ability in the degradation of Polypropylene.
Polyvinylchloride/PVC

Polyvinylchloride is a strong polymer, composed of
repeating chloroethyl units (Fischer et al. 2014), these
are low cost, and show biological and chemical resistance. PVC comes in two forms, i.e., rigid and flexible. Pure PVC is soluble in tetrahydrofuran and
insoluble in alcohols. PVC is similar to the structure of
chlorophenol compounds. Compared with PET and
PS, polyvinylchloride (PVC) is considered to be a hard
plastic for biodegradation. Some fungal species which
showed PVC degradation are Cochliobolus sp. (Sumathi et al. 2016), Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Aspergillus niger (Ali et al. 2014), Penicillium funiculosum
ATCC 9644, Trichoderma viride ATCC 13631, Paecilomyces variotii CBS 62866, Aspergillus niger (ATCC

Srikanth et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing

6275) (Whitney 1996), Aureobasidium pullulans (Webb
et al. 2020), Chaetomium globosum (ATCC 16021) (Vivi
et al. 2018). Some yeast-like fungi Rhodotorula aurantiaca and Kluyveromyces spp also showed some degrading
properties towards polyvinylchloride.
Polystyrene (PS)

Polystyrene is a thermoplastic polymer, aromatic hydrocarbon polymer which is composed of monomers, i.e.,
styrene (John Scheirs 2003). They are in the form of
solid or foamed, its chemical formula is ­(C8H8) n. PP is
degraded by acetone, chlorinated solvents, and aromatic
hydrocarbon solvents. It is used for protective packaging such as packing food items and jewel cases and used
for manufacturing cases for CDs, DVDs, containers, lids,
bottles, trays, tumblers, etc. Degrading polystyrene ability was identified in Cephalosporium spp. and Mucor spp.
Gloeophyllum striatum DSM 9592 and Gloeophyllum
trabeum DSM 1398 strains causing almost 50% reduction
in molecular weight of polystyrene. White rot fungi Pleurotus ostreatus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and Trametes versicolor, and the brown-rot fungi Gloeophyllum
trabeum were capable of depolymerization of polystyrene
when coincubated together with lignin (Krueger et al.
2015; Milstein et al. 1992). Aspergillus sp., Penicillium
sp., and Fusarium sp. were also identified for their ability
to degrade PET and PS foam (Umamaheswari and Murali
2013) Curvularia species hyphae had adhered to and
penetrated the polymer’s structure (Motta et al. 2009).
Geomyces, Mortierella species also involve in degrading
polystyrene (Oviedo-Anchundia et al. 2021).
Polyurethane/PUR

Polyurethane is a polymer composed of organic units
which are joined by carbamate (urethane) links. They
are in rigid and flexible foam forms, varnishes and coatings, adhesives, electrical compounds, and fibers, such
as spandex and polyurethane laminate (Gama et al. 2018).
Polyurethanes are a type of plastic that has wide use in
industries, they are synthesized from polyols and polyisocyanates. This polyurethane is degraded by the following
fungi, i.e., Gliocladium roseum, Aspergillus spp., Emericella spp., Fusarium spp., Penicillium spp., Trichoderma
spp., Gliocladium pannorum, Nectria gliocladiodes, Penicillium ochrochloron, Aureobasidium pullulans, Rhodotorula aurantiaca, and Kluyvermyces spp (Cosgrove et al.
2007; Lagauskas and Pečiulytė 2009; Webb et al. 2000).
Some fungi such as Plectosphaerella, Nectria, Neonectria,
Phoma, and Alternaria also showed their ability for PU
biodegradation. Aspergillus niger was also identified for
its quite slow growth with visible signs of deterioration
occurring only after 30 days (Russell 2011). Pestalotiopsis microspora, utilizing polyurethane as a carbon source

Page 6 of 10

with an enzyme serine hydrolase and degrade it within
a few days (Russell 2011). Comamonas acidovorans produce polyurethane esterase that degrades polyurethane
and low and high molecular weight polylactic acid
(Bhardwaj et al. 2012). In degradation of polyurethane,
proteases are more effective than esterases (Ozsagiroglu et al. 2012). Recent studies identified Candida ethanolica (Zafar et al. 2013), and Candida rugosa (Gautam
et al. 2007) as PUR degraders. Cladosporium pseudo cladosporioides, Cladosporium tenuissimum, Cladosporium
asperulatum, Cladosporium montecillanum, Aspergillus
fumigatus, Penicillium chrysogenum were also reported
for degrading PUR (Álvarez-Barragán et al. 2016; Mathur
and Prasad 2012).
Polycarbonate/PC

Polycarbonate is a thermoplastic polymer that contains
carbonate groups (−O−(C=O). its rigid and strong polymer. It is used in manufacturing electronic components
such as TVs screens computer screens, compact discs,
DVDs, automotive, aircraft, and some security elements
such as bulletproof sheets, eyeglasses/lenses. Degradation of polycarbonates is typical in-process due to its
rigid structure and usually takes years. Phanerochaete
chrysosporium NCIM 1170 a white-rot fungus showed
degrading properties towards polycarbonates (Artham
and Doble 2010). Geotrichum spp., are identified by their
aryl alcohol oxidases and M
­ n2+-oxidizing peroxidase
enzymes and degrading polycarbonates (Romero et al.
2007). Some common fungal species which are showing
biodegradation of polycarbonates are Fusarium, Ulocladium, Chrysosporium, and Penicillium (Arefian et al.
2013).
Plastic polymer biodegradation by edible fungi

Edible fungi/Edible Mushrooms which are considered
macrofungi are fleshy and fruit bodies which is rich in
their nutritional benefits. They are artificially cultivated
on a suitable substrate, such as straw, husk, sugarcane
residues, leaves, etc. The mushrooms grow on the surface of the substrate by absorbing the nutrients from the
substrate. In the place of other substrates, plastic films/
sheets are used as substrate. Some important fungi species which showed their ability to absorb nutrients from
the plastic polymers they are Pleurotus abalones, Pleurotus ostreatus, Agaricus bisporus these species are by
secretion of enzyme laccases utilized the polyethylene
and polystyrene as carbon sources and showed growth by
degrading the plastics. (Hock et al. 2019). Pleurotus eryngii, Lentinula edodes, fungi showed the ability to degrade
BPA (Bisphenol-A) and DEHP (di-2-ethyhexylphthalate)
plastics by secretion of manganese peroxidase (MnP)
enzyme (Hock et al. 2019). The capability of degrading

green polyethylene and oxo-biodegradable (D2W) plastics without prior physical treatment was observed
in Pleurotus ostreatus. The formation of mushrooms
from the plastic as a substrate is a very new approach to
control plastic pollution, and the productivity of mushrooms can be increased by altering the composition of
the substrate (Luz et al. 2013).

Conclusions
The increase in plastic pollution greatly affects living organisms, biodegradation of plastics by fungi can
help to decrease the problem. Biodegradation of plastic
polymers has been one of the current focussed areas of
research on solving plastic pollution. The review provides
eminent information on various fungi which are involved
in degrading different types of plastic polymers, and specific degrading enzymes produced by various fungi which
are involved in the biodegradation mechanism. Though
many studies identified the degrading abilities in fungi
very few shows effective biodegradation. Genetic engineering could be a preferred strategy to enhance the ability of fungi in biodegradation of plastic polymers. Several
strategies, such as random mutagenesis and site-directed
mutagenesis, genome editing, advanced computational
modelling, computational genomics, are the recent strategies to address enzyme engineering. In addition, genetically engineered robust enzyme systems could be an
effective strategy to reduce plastic waste.
