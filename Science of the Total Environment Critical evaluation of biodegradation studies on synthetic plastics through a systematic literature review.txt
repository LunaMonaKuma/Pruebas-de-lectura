Increasing amounts of plastic waste in the environment and their fragmentation into smaller particles known as
microplastics (particles, <5 mm) have raised global concerns due to their persistency in the environment and
their potential to act as vectors for harmful substances or pathogenic microorganisms. One possible solution to
this problem is biodegradation of plastics by microorganisms. However, the scientiﬁc information on plasticdegrading microorganisms is scattered across different scientiﬁc publications. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) with predeﬁned criteria using the online databases of Scopus and Web of Science to ﬁnd papers
on bacterial biodegradation of synthetic petroleum-based polymers. The aims of this SLR were to provide an updated list of all of the currently known bacteria claimed to biodegrade synthetic plastics, to determine and deﬁne
the best methods to assess biodegradation, to critically evaluate the existing studies, and to propose directions for
future research on polymer biodegradation in support of more rapid development of biodegradation technologies. Most of the bacteria identiﬁed here from the 145 reviewed papers belong to the phyla Proteobacteria,
Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and most were isolated from contaminated sites, such as landﬁll sites. Just
under a half of the studies (44%) investigated the biodegradability of polyethylenes and derivates, particularly
low-density polyethylenes. The methods used to monitor the biodegradation were mainly scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. We propose that: (1) future research should focus on biodegradation of microplastics arising from the most common pollutants (e.g. polyethylenes); (2) bacteria should
be isolated from environments that are permanently contaminated with plastics; and (3) a combination of different observational methods should be used to conﬁrm bacterial biodegradation of these plastics. Finally, when
reporting, researchers need to follow standard protocols and include all essential information needed for repetition of the experiments by other research groups.

The most commonly used polymers that end up as plastic debris in
the environment are polyethylenes (PEs, including; linear low density
[LLDPE], low density [LDPE], medium density [MDPE], high density
[HDPE]), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene
(PS), nylon, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and polyurethane (PUR) (Alauddin et al., 1995). Most of these
are thermoplastics (polymers built of long carbon chains), which makes
them highly resistant to degradation or hydrolytic cleavage of chemical
bonds. Some, such as PUR, are thermosetting plastic polymers with
highly cross-linked structures that are potentially susceptible to degradation by hydrolytic cleavage of chemical bonds (Alauddin et al., 1995).
When plastic particles are exposed to abiotic factors, such as UV irradiation from sunlight, they undergo photo oxidation, which causes them
to deteriorate, lose their tensile strength, become brittle and crumble
into small fragments and particles, known as microplastics (Sivan,
2011). These microplastics are characterised as water-insoluble solid
polymer particles that are ≤5 mm in size; particles ≤1 μm in size are usually referred to as nanoplastics (Koelmans et al., 2019).
In general, the degradation of plastics involves conversion of the
polymers into smaller subunits through breakage of their bonds by
physical, chemical or biological processes with a resulting alteration in
the physicochemical properties of the polymers (Chauhan et al.,
2018). This degradation is therefore inﬂuenced by both abiotic (e.g. mechanical stress, light or temperature) and biotic (e.g. naturally occurring
microorganisms like bacteria, fungi and algae) factors, as well as the
time frame (Haider et al., 2019). Biodegradation is a complex process
of physicochemical transformation of polymers into smaller units
through the actions of microorganisms (Chiellini and Solaro, 1996).
Therefore, biodegradable polymers are materials that are completely
converted (over a limited period of time) by aerobic microorganisms
into carbon dioxide, water, minerals and biomass, or in the case of anaerobic biodegradation, into carbon dioxide, methane and humic material. This biodegradation into their constituent parts does not leave any
potentially harmful substances (Kyrikou and Briassoulis, 2007). The degree of biodegradability of plastics depends on their chemical and physical properties. The features with the most inﬂuence on biodegradation
are the surface conditions (surface area and hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties), the ﬁrst-order structures (chemical structure and molecular weight and its distribution), and the higher-order structures
(glass transition temperature, melting temperature, modulus of elasticity, crystallinity and crystal structure) (Tokiwa et al., 2009).

1. Introduction
Plastics are long-chain manmade polymeric molecules (Scott, 1999)
that have many favourable traits, such as strength, ﬂexibility, extreme
durability, low weight and easy and low-cost production. Their uses
and applications have been steadily growing over the last 150 years
(Sivan, 2011), resulting in an increase in worldwide production of plastics from 1.5 million tonnes in 1950 to 360 million tonnes in 2018 (APM,
2019). Until recently, plastics pollution in the environment was considered merely an aesthetic inconvenience; however, new discoveries
have raised concerns about the potential deteriorative impacts of plastics on the biota and on human health (Sivan, 2011). The main environmental and health threats of plastics arise from their accumulation and
persistence in the environment and their fragmentation into small particles over time (i.e. microplastics; <5 mm), as well as their potential
“for serving as” vessels for toxic chemicals and pathogens (Mato et al.,
2001; Shah et al., 2008; Chua et al., 2014; Caruso, 2019).
Plastic pollution of marine environments is now recognised as a
global-scale threat with adverse effects that span from the molecular
level to physiological performance and organism health and beyond
to the loss of ecosystem services (Avio et al., 2017; Kanhai et al.,
2020). Estuarine and freshwater environments most likely represent
a major source of inland plastic pollution to marine environments
(Eerkes-Medrano et al., 2015; Nel et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2019;
Amrutha and Warrier, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020), and in the form of
microplastics, plastics are also concentrated in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) during the primary and secondary treatment
processes (Talvitie et al., 2017; Masiá et al., 2020), and they accumulate as plastic debris at landﬁll sites (Canopoli et al., 2020). Plastics
also increasingly enter the soil through sewage sludge and wastewater used as fertilisers, and they are widely used in agriculture as
protecting covers (e.g. greenhouses, low tunnels, mulching, and
other uses), as coatings for fertilisers, pesticides, hormones and
seeds, and as packaging materials (Riggi et al., 2011; Nizzetto et al.,
2016). Currently, the problem of increasing and unknown quantities
of microplastics in the environment is recognised as equally important as the plastic debris accumulating along the coasts and in the
oceans around the world (Horton et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2020).
New approaches are needed to cope with this extensive environmental issue, and microbial degradation is one promising strategy
(Shah et al., 2008; Jacquin et al., 2019; Malachová et al., 2020).

Further objectives of this SLR are to identify the missing gaps in the current state of the art in the ﬁeld of biodegradation of synthetic polymers
and to provide recommendations for future research. For this SLR, we
were speciﬁcally interested in identifying: (a) all bacteria that have
been clearly shown to break the chemical bonds in synthetic polymers;
(b) the most practical and efﬁcient observational methods for biodegradation studies; and (c) the research gaps and the most promising research directions in the ﬁeld of polymer biodegradation that will help
to remediate the problem of the increasing presence of both larger plastic debris and microplastics in the environment.

The number of scientiﬁc publications on biodegradation of different
types of plastics is gradually increasing, and several reviews have already summarised the emerging state of the art in this ﬁeld. For example, Zheng et al. (2005) synthesised the knowledge at the time on the
technological advances that had been made in the development of
more easily biodegradable plastics. This included an evaluation of the
biodegradation of conventional plastics by microorganisms, in order to
adopt alternative methods for reducing the impact of plastic waste on
the environment. Similarly, Kyrikou and Briassoulis (2007) delineated
the degradability of polymers used in agriculture by reviewing the
state of the art at the time. They listed 12 studies on LDPE biodegradation and one for PE, HDPE, PP and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
They also summarised the existing standards for biodegradation and
compostability of plastic materials. Gautam et al. (2007a) provided an
overview of their current state of plastic foam biodegradation, including
the biodegradation pathways of a few selected synthetic polymers. Shah
et al. (2008) published an excellent review of 29 biodegradation studies
on different types of plastics. They summarised various techniques that
had been applied for the analysis of plastic degradation in vitro, provided a list of microorganisms reported to degrade different types of
plastics, and recommended more uniform standards for assessment of
the degradative abilities of these microorganisms. Two subsequent reviews on biodegradation of PEs by Sangale et al. (2012) and RestrepoFlórez et al. (2014) examined 34 and 57 studies, respectively. In 2015,
a similar review to that of Shah et al. (2008) was provided by Kale
et al. (2015), where they presented a new list of 20 biodegradation studies carried out between 2004 and 2014 on different types of plastics.
Raziyafathima et al. (2016) reviewed the plastic-degrading efﬁciency
of microbes and their involvement in the degradation of plastic waste;
the authors included different references to those provided by Kale
et al. (2015). Ho et al. (2017) provided an extensive review of 20 studies
on the biodegradation of PS and concluded that PS can be biodegraded,
although at a slow rate. Wilkes and Aristilde (2017) carried out a review
of 16 studies on the factors that control the processing of different plastic polymers and their by-products by Pseudomonas spp. In 2017, Pathak
and Navneet (2017) derived a list of microorganisms associated with
degradation of synthetic (i.e. PE, PVC and PUR) and bio-based polymers
based on the data from seven studies, including some reviews. Urbanek
et al. (2018) carried out a review of 16 studies to assess the knowledge
of plastic degradation and plastic–microorganism interactions in cold
marine habitats and indicated that some of the microorganisms isolated
from these environments could degrade plastic waste from ecosystems.
More recently, two comprehensive reviews that addressed biodegradation by marine microorganisms and the recent achievements in the area
of biodegradation have provided extended and updated lists of microbes reported to degrade different types of synthetic polymers
(Jacquin et al., 2019; Moharir and Kumar, 2019). Very recently, Ghatge
et al. (2020) and Montazer et al. (2020) summarised the current state
of the art in the ﬁeld of PE biodegradation. In addition to these reviews,
several shorter reviews have been published (e.g. Gnanavel et al., 2012;
Muthukumar and Veerappapillai, 2015; Sharma et al., 2015; Kumar
et al., 2017).
Scientiﬁc reviews usually provide the expert with a synthesis of scientiﬁc evidence, and if a review is carefully constructed, it is termed systematic literature review (SLR) and can provide insights into the
reproducibility of published data and the pooled estimates of ‘common
truth’ through meta-analyses (Daldrup-Link, 2018). Our aim in the
present paper was to achieve this type of insight into the current state
of the art in the ﬁeld of synthetic polymer biodegradation by carrying
out a SLR with clearly deﬁned selection criteria and using consistent
methodologies for data extraction. In this SLR, we have synthesised
the major ﬁndings of an extensive literature review on the biodegradation of synthetic (petroleum based) polymers that includes 145 studies
published in peer-reviewed scientiﬁc journals, and we use metaanalysis (i.e. the quantitative synthesis, analysis and summary of a collection of studies; Hedges and Olkin, 1985) to summarize our ﬁndings.

2. Methodology
The focus of this SLR is those studies that report bacterial degradation of synthetic plastics, rather than bioplastics (i.e. plastic materials
produced from renewable biomass resources, such as vegetable fats
and oils, corn starch, straw, woodchips, sawdust, recycled food waste
and others). The search for relevant peer-reviewed papers on bacterial
degradation (biodegradation) of synthetic plastics was conducted
across two databases of peer-reviewed literature: Scopus and Web of
Science (WoS). The following search strings were used:
• Scopus: (biodegradation OR “biological degradation”) AND (microorganism* OR bacteria) AND (plastic OR plastics) NOT (bioplastic* OR
“biodegradable plastic”)
• WoS: TITLE-ABS-KEY ((biodegradation OR “biological degradation”)
AND (microorganism OR bacteria) AND (plastic) AND NOT (bioplastic
OR “biodegradable plastic”))
These searches included papers published up to 17 June, 2020. Potentially, some papers might have been overlooked, especially those
that are not included in the Scopus or WoS databases or did not use
the term ‘biodegradation’. The records obtained were ﬁrst checked for
duplication. If a publication was present in both databases, one record
was removed. The abstracts were then read to check the suitability of
the papers, as predeﬁned. Papers were included if they reported an original study in English and were excluded if they reported experiments
with only fungi or involving biodegradation of only bioplastics, or if
they examined solely physical or chemical processes, and not biological
degradation. Each abstract was checked by at least two authors to conﬁrm suitability.
For improved clarity, we separately listed papers that were included
in this SLR through systematic extraction of the required data using
questionnaires (listed in Appendix A). The selected papers were then
thoroughly read and the relevant information was extracted and gathered using an online predesigned questionnaire built using an opensource application (https://www.1ka.si/d/en). The questionnaire enabled us to predeﬁne the information we wanted to obtain from the papers examined; thereby allowing extraction of structured and
consistent data for to objective responses to the identiﬁed research
questions. Again, two authors examined each paper and ﬁlled in the
questionnaires.
In the questionnaire, general information about a paper, including
unique ID, ﬁrst author, publication year, and DOI number (where provided), was gathered and its suitability conﬁrmed. Further information
was then collected for those papers deemed suitable, including the origin of samples, bacteria tested and type of experiment conducted (e.g.
degradation). Information on methodological approaches (i.e. study design, experimental conditions and observation methods) and results
was then collected. When all relevant papers had been examined and
the questionnaires completed, the data were extracted in the form of
data worksheets for further analysis. Possible different outputs of questionnaires by different examiners were discussed to obtain mutual
agreement on the answers.
The data obtained were consolidated in the form of Tables and Figures, and statistical analyses were performed when possible. Both

Among these 145 studies, only 9.7% used a material that can be classiﬁed as microplastic (i.e. particles <5 mm), whereas 52.4% of the studies were related to larger plastic pieces (>5 mm). In total and 37.9% of
the studies did not deﬁne the size of the plastics. Most studies reported
the use of plastics in the form of ﬁlms, foils or sheets (49.0%) or strips
(12.4%) (Table 1). Overall 9.0% of the studies, investigated plastic dust
or nanoparticles, whereas 4.1%, of the studies did not report the physical
form of the plastics used. Almost half studies (46.9%) provided data on
the material surface area used in experiments, and another 13.8% reported the material volume (Table 1). However, 37.2% of the studies
did not report on the amount of material used in biodegradation experiments (e.g. surface area or volume). A study by Chinaglia et al. (2018)
revealed that the form of material is highly relevant, as the rates of biodegradation of the biodegradable aliphatic polyester polybutylene
sebacate is affected by its particle size and surface area. The biodegradation rate was signiﬁcantly slower for pellets (1 g, surface area, 33 cm2)
than for other smaller samples (double dose 2 g; with surface areas of
193 cm2, 825 cm2), which had a biodegradation rate similar to that of
cellulose.
Globally, approximately 42% of all non-ﬁbre plastics are used for
packaging (mostly PE, PP and PET) and 19% in the building and construction sectors (mostly PVC) (Geyer et al., 2017). Similarly, in
Europe, the biggest demand for plastics is for packaging (40%), followed
by building and construction (20%), and then other uses (e.g. in appliances, mechanical engineering, furniture and medicine; 17%). The
most widely used plastic materials are PP (19.3%), LDPE/LLDPE
(17.5%) and HDPE/MDPE (12.2%) (APM, 2019). The compositions of
the microplastics that contaminate different environmental compartments therefore mainly correspond to those contributing to the global
demand and production. For example, in freshwaters and drinking
water, microplastic particles occur in amounts of PE ≈ PP > PS > PVC
> PET (Koelmans et al., 2019), whereas PP prevails in freshwater sediments (Peng et al., 2018), PE in ﬂoodplain soils (Scheurer and Bigalke,
2018), PAHs and PET in marine sediments (Martin et al., 2017), and
PAHs in activated sludge (Liu et al., 2019). The ﬁndings of this SLR indicate that almost half of the biodegradation studies have focused on LDPE
or PE biodegradation, in agreement with global use and waste production, as well as with the presence of microplastics in freshwaters. By
contrast, studies on the biodegradation of PP, PS, PAHs and PET are relatively rare, although these are certainly also important pollutants.
Hence, more studies should investigate the biodegradation of these
other materials to develop techniques for their efﬁcient removal them
from the environment, especially when they occur in the form of dispersedly distributed microplastics.

SigmaPlot (Systat Software, San Jose, CA) and the ggplot2 package
(Wickham, 2016) in R software (R Core Team, 2019) were used to construct graphs, and R was to calculate Pearson's correlation coefﬁcients
between treatment temperatures and lengths of studies for the two
most commonly reported bacterial genera, Pseudomonas and Bacillus,
and their mixtures. Prior to analysis, the data were log(x + 1) transformed to meet linear assumptions. We also compared correlations
against each other by testing for signiﬁcant differences using an online
test available on Psychometrica (Eid et al., 2011; Lenhard and Lenhard,
2014).
3. Biodegradation studies
The application of the above-mentioned search strings identiﬁed
1901 papers: 370 from WoS and 1531 from the Scopus database. The
ﬁnal number of studies obtained for this SLR was 145. The number of
published articles reporting on bacterial degradation of plastics has
steadily increased over the last 50 years (Appendix B, Fig. B.1). The afﬁliations of the ﬁrst authors indicated, a varying number of SCI papers
from 35 different countries (Appendix B, Table B.1) with highest number coming from India (33.8% of all 145 studies). India is also one of
the countries with the highest rates of inadequately disposed waste
(i.e. plastic waste that has the intention of being managed through
waste collection or storage sites, but is not sufﬁciently managed and
can be lost to the surrounding environment) (Jambeck et al., 2015).
An interesting idea for future analyses would be to compare these results to those of national statistics in terms of waste management or demographics, for example.
3.1. Types of polymers
Over 20% of the studies included reports on investigations into LDPE
biodegradation, while 14.5% of them reported on PE biodegradation
(Fig. 1). PS, PP, HDPE, PET and the other plastics have been tested less
often for their biodegradability (<10% of the studies). About a quarter
used different combinations of plastic materials (i.e., mixtures) of, for
example, LDPE and HDPE or of LDPE and PP to investigate biodegradation; therefore, a clear understanding of the individual biodegradation
mechanisms could not be obtained. Some studies (3.4%) also did not report the speciﬁc type of plastics used in the experiments but instead
used ambiguous names (e.g. plastics) or plastic products (e.g. e-waste,
keyboards). Again, this precluded drawing any general conclusions regarding on the interactions between certain polymers and the bacteria
being tested.

3.2. Experimental conditions
The environmental conditions are key for microbial metabolism. Accurate information on the autecological requirements of plasticdegrading bacteria are needed when they are tested in biodegradation
studies. Hence, reports on biodegradation should include all essential
information needed to repeat the studies, or to improve and upgrade
the experiments. At a minimum, this information should include the information on pretreatment, growth medium, temperature and length of
experiments.
3.2.1. Pretreatment
Although physical and chemical pre-treatments can greatly increase
the bioavailability of polymers, around 11.7% of the 145 studies did not
perform any pre-treatments, and 15.9% did not report on this. Most of
the studies using pre-treatments only used one form (61%). Most of
them reported on washing the original materials using distilled water
or ethanol (26%), or by exposure to UV (4.8%). Around 18.6% of these
pre-treatment studies reported on the use of two different forms of
pre-treatment, most of which were thermal pre-treatments in combination with washing with water or ethanol (4.1%). Pretreatment with UV
light was the second most commonly used pretreatment, although this
was applied in only eight studies. Several plastic materials are indeed
photosensitive, and according to Lucas et al. (2008), one of the most important parameters in abiotic degradation is exposure to light radiation.
Photo-degradation is a process of decomposition that is generally initiated by UV and visible light and structural and morphological changes
in plastics caused by UV irradiation have been reported in several studies (e.g. Fechine et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2016). Pretreatment of plastics
using abiotic factors like UV light or high temperatures can substantially
improve their biodegradation (Lucas et al., 2008; Arkatkar et al., 2009;
Carol et al., 2012). These abiotic factors can weaken of the polymeric
structure, initiate the biodegradation process, and can even be considered as synergistic factors (Lucas et al., 2008).
Thermal and photo-degradation are similar under normal conditions (Fotopoulou and Karapanagioti, 2019). Thermal degradation is basically a ‘molecular deterioration as a result of overheating’, where the
splitting of the chemical bonds is initiated by high temperatures. The
components of the long-chain backbone of the polymer begin to separate and react with one another, thereby changing the polymer properties (Shah et al., 2008). Thermal degradation of thermoplastic polymers
occurs when the polymer is transformed from a solid to a liquid. At
melting temperatures, the thermosetting plastics do not have a ﬂuid
state; therefore the original material does not change state at temperatures below the temperature at which thermal decomposition occurs.
Consequently, the material does not undergo any notable physical
transformation before decomposition (Beyler and Hirschler, 2002).
The papers reviewed in this SLR have included thermal pretreatments
consisting mainly of autoclaving (Gautam et al., 2007b) and drying at
70 °C to 90 °C for 10 days in a hot air oven (Sudhakar et al., 2008;
Arkatkar et al., 2009; Awasthi et al., 2017).
Most polymeric materials that end up in landﬁll sites or disperse in
the environment are exposed to weathering, ageing and burying,
which can induce mechanical, light, thermal and/or chemical transformations that can modify the biodegradation of these polymeric materials. Hence, biodegradation experiments should include pretreatment
as an essential component to imitate natural in-situ conditions and to
facilitate efﬁcient biodeterioration of plastic debris.

studies (N = 145). Length of studies ranged from as short as 4 days to as long as 10
years. NA – not known.

bacteria growing on plastics. Generally, long incubations should be
used when bacteria have access to other nutrients during biodegradation experiments.
Just over half the studies carried out degradation experiments extending from 1 to 6 months (51.7%), while one third exposed plastics
to bacteria for one month or less (33.1%) (Fig. 2). Longer studies of 6
months to 1 year or 1 to 5 years were rare as 7.6% and 4.8%, respectively.
Two studies were conducted for 10 years or more, and two studies did
not indicate the duration of the degradation experiments.
Davis et al. (2005) proposed incubation times for soil bacteria ranging from one week to one month, as has been used in biodegradation
studies in many cases, but many studies treated polymers for periods
longer than one month. These longer durations have resulted in many
successful experiments with isolated biodegrading bacteria and in
changes in the polymer materials. Hence, giving the microorganisms
enough time to grow and actually use the carbon from the plastics is
an important step in their degrading of these synthetic materials.
3.2.3. Growth condition
Temperature is considered as probably the most important environmental factor that affects the growth and survival of microorganisms
(Madigan et al., 2012). Most of the 145 studies involved experiments
conducted at temperatures from 26 °C to 30 °C (30.3%) and from 36 °C
to 40 °C (13.1%) (Fig. 3). Overall, 22.1% of the studies did not report

3.2.2. Study length
There is no conclusive data on how long it takes for plastics to be
biodegraded in the environment (but see Chamas et al., 2020). Only a
few studies on degradation of plastics have been performed in the natural environment; therefore, many questions remain unanswered
(Fotopoulou and Karapanagioti, 2019). The chemical bonds in polymers
are difﬁcult to break, so they are not easily accessible as nutrients for

temperatures. The ranges starting at 0 °C include studies where experiments were

was used to observe the changes to the treated plastics. The most common techniques used to evaluate polymer degradation were a combination of visual surface changes, determined mainly using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and measurements of weight loss and
chemical changes, determined mainly using Fourier-transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy. Alongside FTIR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), high temperature GPC, UV–visible spectroscopy,
thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) when applied. Analysis of thermal proﬁles by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), thermogravimetry/derivative thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis (TG-DTG-DTA), and differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC), also provided information on both the physical and
chemical characteristics, in 8, 4 and 10 studies, respectively. 84.1% of
the studies reported using methods for observing the growth of bacteria
exposed to polymer materials. The most widely used methods were genome/metagenome analyses (10.3%), measurements of respiration
rates (6.9%), viable colony counts (6.2%) and direct visual observations
(5.5%). Respiration rates in most studies were assessed by measurements of carbon dioxide production.
Degradation is any change in the physical or chemical properties due
to chemical, physicochemical (e.g. photo-degradation, thermal and mechanical degradation) or biological processes (Shah et al., 2008). Biodeterioration, which includes the combined actions of members of the
microbial community, is considered the ﬁrst step in biodegradation
and involves a superﬁcial degradation that modiﬁes the mechanical,
physical and chemical properties of a given material. The second step
is the cleavage of the polymeric molecules into oligomers, dimers or
monomers through catalytic agents secreted by microorganisms; this
process is referred to as depolymerisation. The next step is assimilation,
which refers to the integration of the molecules to produce energy and
new biomass and for other metabolic processes. The last step is
mineralisation, which is the excretion of simple and different salts and
of complex metabolites into the extracellular surroundings
(Fotopoulou and Karapanagioti, 2019). The complete breakdown of
large polymers to carbon dioxide usually requires several different organisms, each of which can attack different chemical bonds, ﬁrst within
the polymers and then within the monomers (Gu et al., 2011).
Polymer degradation, whether occurring by photochemical, thermal, chemical or biological processes, has to result in bond scission
and the subsequent chemical transformations of the plastics, with
the formation of new functional groups. This is reﬂected in the mechanical, optical and electrical changes observed in the material
characteristics (Shah et al., 2008). Hence, studies of degradation processes can include a variety of approaches that monitor changes in
different polymer characteristics, although careful design is needed
to discriminate between biologically driven degradation and other
degradation processes. Light (i.e. UV-A, UV-B), high temperatures
and pressures, chemical conditions and biological activities are all
possible sources for changes in polymer characteristics. All studies
should therefore provide full and accurate reports of all parameters
important for the biodegradation of plastics.
A clear understanding of microbial–plastic interactions requires, that
all studies reporting on plastic biodegradation by microbes are able to
link this biodegradation to a biotic factor (e.g. a bacterial species or consortium), while excluding abiotic factors. One method (e.g. weight loss)
can be a beneﬁcial tool for preliminary studies, but different methods
need to be used in combination for a reliable establishment of the link
between microbes and biodegradation. The methods used should be
limited to those that have been shown to produce the most relevant
data. This limitation should be followed to minimise non-standardised
reporting on methodological approaches and the data obtained, as this
is one of the main obstacles that currently prevents a clear analysis of
the present state of the art, and that in turn inhibits further technological developments.

the temperature for the degradation Skariyachan et al. (2017) reported
an experimental temperature range from 4 °C to 55 °C, and they observed bacterial growth in media with a mixture of LDPE and HPDE at
ﬁve different temperatures (4, 25, 37, 45 and 55 °C). Generally, as temperature increases, the rate of metabolism increases, until it rapidly declines at higher temperatures where irreversible changes in cells occur
(Schulte, 2015). It is likely that temperature has a direct impact also
on plastic degradation rates. Pischedda et al. (2019) addressed the effects of temperature on the speed of plastics biodegradation in soil
media, and demonstrated that the biodegradation rate is perfectly described by the Arrhenius equation in the tested temperature range
(15–28 °C). While different microorganisms can grow also at temperatures below freezing or even above the boiling point of water, no known
organisms can grow across this whole temperature range, as the range
for any given organism is typically 25 °C to 40 °C (Madigan et al.,
2012). Generally, four classes of microorganisms can be deﬁned based
on their growth temperature optima: psychrophiles (0–20 °C, optimal
temperature, ≤15 °C); mesophiles (20–45 °C); thermophiles (45–80
°C, optimum temperature, >45 °C); and hyperthermophiles (optimum
temperature, >80 °C) (Madigan et al., 2012). The microorganisms investigated in the reviewed studies here were mostly isolated from environmental samples that were collected from temperate or tropical
latitudes, and they are hence most probably mesophiles. While about
half of the studies reported on degradation temperatures from 26 °C
to 40 °C, 22.1% of the studies did not report the temperature for the degradation experiments, or they were not precise enough (e.g., ‘ambient
temperature’). The temperature is one of the most important parameters in these experiments, and it should be chosen and reported fully
and accurately. As such, it is our suggestion that the temperature should
always be measured, even during outdoor experiments, and then included in scientiﬁc reports. Within the reviewed studies here, the
greatest temperature range covered was from 4 °C to 55 °C, where
Skariyachan et al. (2017) compared the degradation potential of formulated microbial consortia (IS1-IS4) from cow dung under thermophilic
conditions (55 °C) in comparison to other temperatures (4, 25, 37, 45
°C). It would be interesting to check for biodegraders among the microorganisms that live in extreme environments (i.e., very hot or very
cold).
Most studies (65.5%) did not report the pH of the medium, but most
cases that did report pH (9.0%) indicated pH 7. Some studies tested several different pH values (Peng et al., 2014; Sarkhel et al., 2019), or samples with different pH readings (Lim et al., 2005; Tourova et al., 2020).
Bacteria were often grown in vivo (28.3%), and only two studies did
not disclose the media used. A popular medium choice was mineral
salt medium (in 15.2%), as well as, Bushnell-Haas or the liquid carbonfree basal medium (both in 3.4% of the studies). Several studies have
used media without the addition of a carbon; like mineral medium
(Pandey, 2014; Satyalakshmi, 2016; Farzi et al., 2019), thereby forcing
the bacteria to use the carbon from the plastics and consequently degrade them. By contrast, Shabbir et al. (2020) added different carbon
sources when assessing changes in PE. The polydispersity index (Mw/
Mn) was 7.82 for the control, 7.68 without a carbon source, and 6.82
with glucose. Similarly, Mw/Mn was lower for PP (4.47 for the control,
4.35 without a carbon source, and 3.90 with glucose) and for PET
(2.44 for the control, 2.32 without a carbon source, and 2.28 with glucose). They reported higher relative abundances of the phyla in the
glucose-treated samples, and this could explain the greater biodegradation of microplastics after glucose addition. This ﬁnding will be particularly interesting to consider in planning future studies.
3.3. Observational methods
Many studies (15.9%) reported either on the changes in surface texture of the treated plastics, weight loss, tensile strength, or chemical attributes during the biodegradation experiments. However, in many
studies, a combination of two (27.6%) or three (25.5%) of these methods
6

Science of the Total Environment 752 (2021) 141959

Most members of the phylum Firmicutes are Gram-positive bacteria
that can form endospores and are found primarily in the soil (Madigan
et al., 2012). The most commonly mentioned organisms were members
of the Bacillus genus, which currently has 282 known valid species
(Parte, 2018; accessed on 19 March, 2020). The bacteria of this genus
can form oval or cylindrical endospores, and they can function as aerobes or facultative aerobes. Several strains can produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes that can break down complex polymers (e.g. lipids),
for use as carbon sources and electron donors. Many of these bacteria
also produce antibiotics and insecticides (Madigan et al., 2012).
Actinobacteria are a Gram-positive group that includes rod-shaped
to ﬁlamentous, primarily aerobic bacteria commonly found in the soil
and in plant materials. Commercially, they are used for production of
antibiotics and certain fermented dairy products (Madigan et al., 2012).
Among the bacteria identiﬁed as effectively initiating the biodegradation of the synthetic polymers, 21.0% of the studies indicated Pseudomonas, 15% indicated Bacillus and 17% indicated mixtures of these two
genera. A comparison of temperature and exposure time (i.e. study
length) effects across the studies indicated weak negative correlations
and no signiﬁcant relationships, most probably due to the scarce data
and the prevalence of studies carried out in a temperature range of 26
°C to 30 °C (Fig. 4). In case of Pseudomonas (n = 32) the correlation
was weak (−0.34), although close to the signiﬁcance level of p < 0.05
(p = 0.05), suggesting that exposure to higher temperatures with,
shorter incubation times will be needed for this genus to achieve polymer biodegradation. In the example with Bacillus the Pearson's coefﬁcient of the linear relationship between temperature and study length
was also weak (r = −0.29, n = 12, p = 0.36), and a very weak coefﬁcient for their mixtures (r = 0.001, n = 17, p = 1.00). Comparisons of
correlations between datasets revealed no signiﬁcant differences (p >
0.05) for Bacillus and Pseudomonas (z = 0.23, p = 0.41), Bacillus and
mixtures (z = −0.70, p = 0.24), or Pseudomonas and mixtures (z =
−1.11, p = 0.13), indicating similar behaviours of all three tested correlations. Hence, the SLR showed that shorter treatments are needed during biodegradation when experimental temperatures are above room
temperature.
The studies identiﬁed bacteria that were isolated from contaminated
sites, such as landﬁll sites or plastic waste dumps (Kowalczyk et al.,
2016; Mehmood et al., 2016; Awasthi et al., 2017) from oil contaminated sites (Das et al., 2012) and from activated sludge from WWTPs
(Khatoon et al., 2014) (45.9%) (Table 3). Some studies used, bacteria
from banks or synthetic mixtures, while the rest used bacteria obtained
from mixed environmental samples (polluted/unpolluted) or from
natural environments, such as mangrove swamps, soils, sediments,
freshwater, marine environments, animal guts or plant nodes. Contaminated sites are extreme environments due to the presence of biologically toxic compounds and different types of synthetic substrates that
microorganisms can alternatively use. Similarly, the soil is a highly variable environment in terms of nutrient levels, temperature and water
activity (Madigan et al., 2012). These differences promote a high adaptation rate of microbes.
Increasingly more studies have examined the polymer degradation
potential of consortia of different bacteria (Skariyachan et al., 2015;
Skariyachan et al., 2017; Tribedi and Dey, 2017; Skariyachan et al.,
2018; Tourova et al., 2020). Some future studies that might be beneﬁcial
will be investigations into biodegradation processes occurring via
‘syntrophy metabolism’, in which the degradation of compounds follows a metabolic chain where the catabolic product of one species is a
source of carbon for another (Santisi et al., 2015).

A typical case is seen with the use of FTIR spectroscopy analysis. Although this is a powerful tool for observing changes in polymers during
biodegradation, carefully designed studies and monitoring schemes
need to be set up, and standardised reporting is desperately needed.
For example, Tribedi and Dey (2017), Ullah Jamil et al. (2017) and
Kyaw et al. (2012), all studied biodegradation of LDPE. In the ﬁrst
study, the researchers scanned each ﬁlm at room temperature 20
times from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1 and repeated this three times. In
the second study, the spectrum was recorded at 500 cm−1 to 4000
cm−1 without disclosing the temperature. In the third study, the scanning area was not disclosed. In this third study by Kyaw et al. (2012),
the carbonyl index was used to measure the degree of biodegradation,
which was obtained through a formula that used absorption at 1740
cm−1 (the maximum of the carbonyl peak) divided by the absorption
at 1460 cm−1 (the maximum of the carbonyl peak). By contrast,
Tribedi and Dey (2017) used the carbonyl bond index, which represents
the ratio of absorbance peaks of carbonyl (1712 cm−1) and CH2 (1462
cm−1), as well as the terminal double-bond index, which represents
the ratio between the absorbance of the terminal double-bond peak
(908 cm−1) and the mean of the two CH2 peaks (1461, 1471 cm−1).
Conversely, Ullah Jamil et al. (2017) simply reported the different absorbance peaks that were seen. Thus, although all three of these studies reported on microbial degradation of LDPE using FTIR spectroscopy to
assess the chemical changes, the results cannot be compared with any
degree of certainty.
4. Plastic degrading bacteria
Of the 145 studies included here, 138 clearly reported a demonstration of some kind of polymer degradation. Among these 138, 103 reported 246 bacteria strains that biodegraded plastics (Table 2). An
important part of the studies investigated the efﬁciency of degradation
of microbial consortia from different environments. Most of the identiﬁed bacteria belong to the phyla Proteobacteria (48%), Firmicutes
(37.4%) and Actinobacteria (9.8%). Bacteria from different phyla are already widely used for biodegradation of human wastewater (Wu
et al., 2019) and contaminants at oil spill sites (Das and Chandran,
2010), and they have been applied in many other biotechnological processes (e.g. food production and pharmaceuticals). Proteobacteria are
by far the largest and most metabolically diverse phylum of all bacteria,
and they have great importance medically, industrially and agriculturally (Madigan et al., 2012). They have been reported as the most abundant phylum in activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants
(WWTPs) around the globe (82% of all operational taxonomic units)
(Wu et al., 2019), as well as in contaminated riverbed sediments of
the Maozhou river in China (59%) (Liao et al., 2019), in marine sediments (38.6%) (Borin et al., 2009), and in different types of soils
(Buckley and Schmidt, 2001). All are Gram-negative bacteria, and they
show an exceptionally wide range of energy-generating mechanisms
(e.g. chemolithotrophic, chemoorganotrophic and phototrophic species), relationships to oxygen (e.g. anaerobic and facultatively aerobic
species) and cell shapes (e.g. straight and curved rods, cocci and ﬁlaments) (Madigan et al., 2012).
The most common genus mentioned in the reviewed papers was
Pseudomonas, a genus that is ecologically important in soil and water
environments and that currently has 216 known valid species (Parte,
2018; accessed on 19 March, 2020). Similarly, Jacquin et al. (2019) listed
several Pseudomonas strains that degrade PE. Other commonly listed
strains were from the genera Bacillus and Brevibacillus, and several
strains of fungi were also mentioned but are not considered in the present SLR. One characteristic property of these plastic-degrading bacteria
is their use of many different organic compounds as carbon and energy
sources (Seo et al., 2009; Shourian et al., 2009; Wilkes and Aristilde,
2017). Some species can use over 100 different compounds, even materials of xenobiotic origin, making them important agents of bioremediation in the environment (Madigan et al., 2012).

between the initial polymer weight and the weight after the exposure to
bacteria that achieved biodegradation. These observations of weight
loss were typically combined with another method, such as surface
changes and/or FTIR spectroscopy. Some studies reported no changes,
usually when an untreated polymer was used as the control to compare
polymer blends (Niño et al., 1999; El-Wakil et al., 2020). Among the
studies that reported an observed degradation (n = 138), 65.2% reported weight losses, of up to 10% (Yang et al., 2014; Mukherjee et al.,
2017; Auta et al., 2018; Kumari et al., 2019; Shahreza et al., 2019) or
10% to 20% (Kyaw et al., 2012; Bhatia et al., 2014; Awasthi et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2020). The extent of the weight loss depended on the polymer type and its characteristics, the type of bacteria or consortium, the
pretreatment of the plastic, and the conditions during the experiments
(e.g. study length, temperature and pH). The greatest weight losses
were reported for LDPE and HDPE in the form of foils, ﬁlms or strips
and for Klebsiella pneumonia CH001 (Awasthi et al., 2017) and different
Pseudomonas strains (Kyaw et al., 2012; Bhatia et al., 2014). In many
studies, the exact extent of the weight loss could not be extracted
from the publications due to insufﬁcient reporting.

5.2. Tensile strength
The changes in the tensile strength of the plastics were usually determined using a tensile testing machine (e.g. INSTRON 5566, as used
by Kyaw et al., 2012) and were measured as the percentage losses in
tensile strength (Kyaw et al., 2012), elongation at the break point (%),
or ultimate tensile strength (i.e. the stress that the material withstood
while being stretched to breaking point) measured in units of
megapascals (MPa) (Kyaw et al., 2012; Sarmah and Rout, 2018) or newtons per square metre (N m−2) (Tribedi and Dey, 2017). Some international standards, such as ASTM D 882-97, are already in use. About 17.4%
of the studies reported using tensile strength changes as an indication of
biodegradation. The tensile strength reductions were usually
characterised as lower for virgin polymers than for blends (Leonas and
Gorden, 1996; Francis et al., 2011); the reductions could even be zero
(Leonas and Gorden, 1996). However, some studies reported substantial reductions in tensile strength during the biodegradation experiments. For example, a study of biodegradation of thermally pretreated
HDPE by Klebsiella pneumoniae CH001 reported a signiﬁcant reduction

index showed a gradual decrease from an initial value of 1.0 to 0.85
after 6 months, to 0.75 after 9 months, and to 0.70 after 1 year, whereas
the carbonyl index increased from 0.0125 to 0.016. The methyl group
index for the untreated PP decreased to 0.76 after 1 year. Novotný
et al. (2018) measured the FTIR spectra of LLDPE ﬁlms before and after
60-day treatments with a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain and reported
a decreased carbonyl band and ﬂattening of the 1300–1100 cm−1 zone
due to the bacterial action.
Changes in thermal proﬁles have also been assessed using TGA to
follow the degradation of plastics. For example, Bhatia et al. (2014)
showed that the thermal proﬁle of virgin LDPE had a steep degradation
curve between 450 °C and 500 °C, whereas degraded LDPE showed a
three-step weight loss of 22%, 33% and 46% at 50 °C, 100 °C and 175
°C, respectively. They concluded that bacterial cultures can accelerate
the degradation rate because of direct enzymatic scission and assimilation of low-molecular-weight chains. The three-step degradation curves
were a result of digestion of the hydrocarbon backbone by the isolated
bacteria, Pseudomonas citronellolis EMBS027 (Bhatia et al., 2014).
In addition to FTIR spectroscopy and TGA, Mohan et al. (2016) used
NMR and HPLC analysis to assess microbial-assisted high-impact PS
degradation. They used deuterated chloroform as the internal reference
before and after analysis of high-impact PS samples by NMR. One of the
major peaks reported was between 3 ppm and 4 ppm, which generally
corresponds to –CH2–Br; the control showed, no peak in that region.
They concluded that, because of the bacteria, bromine was released
from the high-impact PS in the form of methyl bromine. They also conducted HPLC analysis of the culture medium following treatment with
Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. detected the presence of phenyl ethanol, an intermediate product in the microbial degradation of PE.
GPC has also been used to determine the number-averaged molecular mass (Mn) and the weight-averaged molecular weight (Mw) of
biodegraded plastics, as well as the Polydispersity Index (Mw/Mn).
Novotný et al. (2018) used GPC combined with other methods (e.g.
FTIR spectroscopy) to assess the deterioration of pretreated LLDPE by
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. After 60 days of exposure to the bacteria at
28 °C, the properties of virgin LLDPE did not change, nor did those of
an abiotic control. Exposure of the pretreated LLDPE to the bacteria resulted in a steady increase in Mn, and increase in Mw and a decrease in
the polydispersity index from 16.9 to 9.4. The authors concluded that
the oligomers in the pretreated LLDPE were removed through the microbial action, and this conclusion was conﬁrmed by other measurements (Novotný et al., 2018).

(~50%) after a 60-day incubation (Awasthi et al., 2017). Similarly, an investigation of PE biodegradation by bacterial strains from the guts of
plastic-eating waxworms indicated a >50% decrease in tensile strength
in PE exposed to Bacillus sp. YP1 or Enterobacter asburiae YT1 (Yang
et al., 2014). Moderate decreases were observed by Agamuthu and
Faizura (2005), where 45-day composting resulted in a 20% decrease
in tensile strength for both HDPE with 3% additive and LLDPE with 7%
additive.
5.3. Surface changes
Surface changes of the plastics were evaluated through visible
changes in the ‘before’ and ‘after’ images from SEM in 60% of the studies,
and these were mainly described as the formation of cracks, pores and
holes. Awasthi et al. (2017) performed SEM image analysis to determine
the degradation of HDPE ﬁlms by the bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae
and claimed that formation of bioﬁlms occurred within 15 days and
that the HDPE ﬁlms were cracked and developed holes when incubated
with K. pneumoniae. Similarly, Kyaw et al. (2012) provided SEM images
of LDPE that revealed surface changes after 3 months of incubation with
selected Pseudomonas strains. Surface changes have also been observed
after 12 months of exposure of PP to different Bacillus strains (Arkatkar
et al., 2009). Similarly, SEM experiments have revealed deterioration of
PET (Austin et al., 2018; Narciso-Ortiz et al., 2020), PS (Chauhan et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2020) and PE (Deshpande et al., 2015; Mukherjee
et al., 2017) by different strains at various incubation times (i.e. 4 days
to a few years).

6. Recommendations for future research
The increasing accumulation of plastics in the environment has created an urgent need to develop technologies for the degradation of the
plastic wastes that currently cannot be recycled and especially for degradation of plastics that pose serious threats to the environment. Especially critical attention is needed for the microplastics that accumulate
in activated sludge during wastewater treatment processes, as this
water is then further used in agriculture or discharged into streams.
Alongside photo, thermal and mechanical deterioration, biodegradation
is a promising approach, and it can provide energy-efﬁcient and costefﬁcient technologies that are also environmentally friendly, although
only if this is carried out under controlled conditions. Hence, understanding what conditions are needed for biodegradation processes is
critical, as is understanding the mechanisms involved.
As a ﬁrst step, microorganisms with high potential for catalysing biochemical changes of these inert materials need to be identiﬁed, and
their interactions with these plastic materials need to be understood
more fully. The second step is to obtain a complete understanding of
the autecology (i.e. the ecological requirements) and metabolic pathways of the relevant organisms, followed by establishment of the
changes caused by the biochemical activity of microbes upon exposure
to plastic materials. Our SLR indicates that the identiﬁcation of potential

5.4. Chemical changes
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy has been the most widely
used method (60.9% of the studies) to evaluate chemical changes in
treated polymers. Changes have usually been depicted as FTIR spectra
and explained as shifts and changes in intensity of the carbonyl bands.
For example, Albertsson et al. (1998) reported changes in the carbonyl
index from 0.196 to 0.143 for initially pretreated LDPE after treatment
with Arthrobacter parafﬁneus, and changes in the double-bond index
from 0.275 to 0.250. Arkatkar et al. (2009) measured the FTIR spectroscopy absorbance of treated PP at 1377 cm−1 and observed decreases
over the time when PP was exposed to bacteria. The methyl group

7. Conclusions

microorganisms is undergoing rapid progress, with 246 bacteria currently identiﬁed as capable of causing some kind of synthetic polymer
change.
The important pools of potential bacteria that can biodegrade plastics are generally located in contaminated sites, such as landﬁll sites,
where bacteria are in close contact with plastic waste. Shah et al.
(2008) suggested that standardised screening of organisms that can degrade polymers, or that produce enzymes or enzyme systems that can
degrade polymers, might well be environmentally proﬁtable in the
21st century, in analogy to the screening programmes used for antibiotics in the 1950s and 1960s. Moreover, rapid technical developments
in our analytical tools for observing biochemical changes in plastics
and in the development of molecular techniques are now providing a
profound understanding of the biodegradation processes. These advances can be accelerated if future experiments are carefully designed
and are clearly, fully and accurately described when they are published.
Very recently, an excellent comprehensive review concluded that
‘current international standards and regional test methods are insufﬁcient in their ability to realistically predict the biodegradability of
carrier bags in marine environment, due to several shortcomings in
experimental procedures and a paucity of information in the scientiﬁc literature’ (Harrison et al., 2018). Hence, the careful design of
biodegradation experiments and the provision of clear and
standardised descriptions of these studies when published will accelerate scientiﬁc progress in the ﬁeld of plastic biodegradation. Another critical consideration is the need for careful deﬁnition of the
terminology used in scientiﬁc publications, such as references to dilution, enrichment, isolation and screening, to ensure reproducibility
of the studies.
When planning, carrying out and reporting biodegradation studies,
the following should be considered:

In this SLR, we have provided a systematic and objective presentation of the data extracted from 145 scientiﬁc papers reporting synthetic
polymer degradation by bacteria. We have shown that, when exposed
to suitable bacterial strain(s), all the tested synthetic polymers show
some kind of surface deterioration or the initiation of chemical changes
due to bacterial activity. However, these changes are minimal and slow,
and reports on them for various tested materials in terms of the biological processes involved have been highly inconsistent between publications. As already highlighted by Shah et al. (2008), a need remains for
international standardisation of biodegradation tests. Even more importantly, researchers should report all of the relevant details of their biodegradation studies to enable replication by others.
We have identiﬁed several gaps in the existing research. A ﬁrst deﬁciency is that the biodegradation of global pollutant–environmental
microplastics has rarely been studied. A second is that, apart from the
biodegradation of PEs, biodegradation of other common plastic pollutants, such as for PP, PS, PVC, PET and PAHs, has been much less intensively investigated. Long-term experiments with incubation times
exceeding 6 months are also lacking; hence, our understanding is limited only to superﬁcial degradation (biodeterioration) under laboratory
conditions and the resultant modiﬁcation of mechanical, physical and
chemical properties. The processes of polymer molecules cleavage by
bacteria (depolymerisation) remain essentially unknown. Studies are
also lacking that mimic ‘outdoor’ biodegradation conditions, where
the bacteria are exposed to natural temperature ranges (4–20 °C; i.e.
most studies are conducted at room temperature of: 26–30 °C). Another
serius gap is that few studies have investigated biodegradation by microbial consortia. Only in- situ studies can provide relevant information
on natural biodegradation processes that can be further transferred to
bioremediation technologies.
Future studies should be oriented towards the use of advanced
chemical analysis to generate a better understanding of the metabolic
pathways at the interface between the exposed polymers and the bacteria, with the aim of including the identiﬁcation of relevant enzyme complexes and the chemical changes they incur. An understanding of the
autecological requirements of potential biodegraders is also important,
along with their optimal niches where their biodegradation is at its
highest. Finally, plastic-contaminated environments are not free of
other more easily accessible carbon resources, so the microbial activities
in such environments should be more intensively studied.

• Biodegradation studies should focus on the materials that are most
commonly present as environmental pollutants. Special concern
should be focussed on the polymers that occur as microplastic pollutants (e.g. PEs, PP, PS, PAHs and PET).
• Contaminated sites (e.g. landﬁll sites, activated sludge from WWTPs,
contaminated soils or sediments), and gut bacteria from invertebrates
that feed on detritus that contains synthetic polymers should be investigated as promising pools of biodegrading bacteria.
• Pretreatment of plastics with UV light or imitation sunlight and moderate temperatures (in accordance with environmental conditions),
and/or by mechanical deterioration (all of which imitate natural conditions) should be included in all biodegradation studies, as no plastic
pollutant or waste is exposed to microorganisms in its virgin form.
Moreover, the synergistic effects should be studied.
• Descriptions of experiments should include at least the information
on the bacteria tested (name, origin) and the plastic material (type,
form, additives), and should report the essential experimental conditions (temperature, pH, growth media, length of study, amount of
plastics, cell density, particle size and surface area, condition of polymer material used – new or aged).
• FTIR spectroscopy has been identiﬁed as the most frequently used
method for observation of biodegradation, as this enables an understanding of the biochemical changes occurring on the polymer
surface; however, a standardised approach for reporting should
be developed that includes the identiﬁcation of the areas that
change due to the biological degradation, the deﬁnition of the parameters that should be observed for each plastic, and the application of standardised indices that can sufﬁciently detect changes in
the polymer structure due to biological activities. Ideally, FTIR
spectroscopy should be used in combination with other methods,
such as HPLC, which enables the identiﬁcation of intermediate
products of biodegradation, or with methods that enable more detailed interpretation of FTIR spectroscopy measurements, such as
DSC, NMR, XPS or GPC.
