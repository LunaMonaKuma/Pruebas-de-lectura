ABSTRACT
Plastics have largely supplanted natural materials such as paper, wood, and metal due to its cost effectiveness, high
flexibility, durability, non-degradability, and fire resistance. Plastic’s increased production, global distribution, and
long-lasting nature eventually lead to environmental accumulation, posing serious concerns to the environment
and biotic health. As a result, in this plastic age, developing appropriate metrics for plastic environmental cleanup
could be a pressing concern. Thus, the capacity of biological systems to break down polymers has recently received
more attention. It has been shown that different fungal strains consume these plastic polymers as their only source
of carbon, converting them into eco-friendly carbon compounds. Various fungal strains, including Aspergillus
nomius, Trichoderma viride, Cephalosporium sp., Stagonosporopsis citrulli, Colletotrichum fructicola, Diaporthe
italiana, and others, have been found to successfully and efficiently degrade various plastic polymers. Mechanism of
biodegradation includes following steps, that is, biodeterioration, biofragmentation, assimilation, and mineralization.
This review mainly focuses on the numerous fungal strains isolated from various sites which engaged in plastic
biodegradation, the biodegradation mechanism, and the various assessment methods used to analyze the extent of
biodegradation process.

1. INTRODUCTION
Plastics are man-made, non-biodegradable composites which are of
substantially petrochemical origin [1]. They come from plants like
corn and sugarcane, as well as from natural gas and oil. About 4%
of the petroleum produced worldwide is utilized to generate plastic,
and an additional 4% is required to fuel the processes used to make
plastic [2]. They are simply made up of hydrogen and carbon with
some other organic and inorganic materials [3]. Plastics have become
universal due to its dual nature as it is a widely used material as well
as considered as an environmental contaminant [4]. In the past few
decades plastic materials have covered each and every sector of human
need. It has replaced the other material such as glass, wood, and metal
that were used in varied applications, due to its distinct properties
that have created the way for its use in enormous sectors [5]. Lowdensity polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE),
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene
(PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate (PC), and polyurethane
(PU) are the most widely used polymers The commonly used plastics
are LDPE, HDPE, PET, PP, PS, PVC, PC, PU, etc. [6,7] [Figure 1].
Widespread applications of plastic leads to large scale production which
is creating an issue of their disposal and management [4]. Over the

course of at least 500 years, about 90% of all plastic created worldwide
persists in the environment [8]. The health of the biotic community in
both terrestrial and aquatic habitats could be severely threatened by
plastic [9-11]. Both the incineration of plastic waste and the dumping
of it in landfills produce significant amounts of CO2 and contribute
to global warming [12]. Air, water, and soil pollution result from
the environmental implications of dumping so much plastic into the
environment [8]. In attempts to develop novel strategies for managing
plastic waste, significant research expenditure has explored whether
bacteria might utilize the commonly contaminated polymers. By doing
so, they could provide a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to
the current extreme usage of plastic [4]. Biodegradation is the most
beneficial approach for plastic degradation compared to other methods
since it is non-polluting in nature. Multiple environmental parameters
and numerous microbial strains are involved in biodegradation [13].
According to reports, the most effective technique to minimize
plastic trash in an environmentally acceptable manner is through
bioremediation, which uses biological agents such as bacteria, fungi,
and algae [14]. Fungi are a varied group of eukaryotic organisms that
can act as saprobes, symbionts, and parasites in nearly all aerobic and
some anaerobic conditions [15].
The significance of fungus in the biodegradation of plastic is
considerable. The presence of pro-oxidant ions and the secretion of
enzymes that aid in degradation, such as proteases, cutinases, and
lipases, has been reported to cause effective degradation by fungi.

the action of enzymes, higher molecular weight compounds can be
converted into lower one by making polymers more hydrophilic [13].
Several fungal strains including Aspergillus clavatus, Trichoderma
viride, Aspergillus nomius, Penicillium sp. have been known to
potentially degrading this alarming plastic waste and providing
a way to get rid of this plastic waste management issue in an ecofriendly way [16-18]. There is a need to create innovative solutions
to both reduce and degrade this waste using a green approach, as the
generation of plastic garbage is a problem that affects the entire globe.
This review article gives a systematic view at the various fungal strains
involved in plastic biodegradation, process of biodegradation, and
various assessment techniques involved.
2. BIODEGRADATION
Plastic polymers are a big threat to the entire world and are not
biodegradable. It would take decades for these plastics to break
down. Biodegradation is the most efficient and ideal method for
plastic breakdown due to its non-polluting mechanism, environmental
friendliness, and economic viability [13]. Microbes are the
intermediaries in a challenging physicochemical process that breaks
down polymers into smaller components [19,20]. Complex organic
molecules can be biochemically broken down, assimilated, and
metabolized by microorganisms, specifically fungi [21,22].
Biodeterioration,
biofragmentation,
assimilation,
and
mineralization are a few of the biochemical degradative routes
for plastic biodegradation. These procedures all rely on different
enzyme functions and bond cleavage [14,23]. Biodeterioration is the
chemical and physical activity of microbes that results in a plastic
polymer’s surface degradation and alteration of its mechanical,
physical, and chemical properties [24]. Adhesion and colonization
of microbes on the surface of the polymer initiates this first step,
the only goal of which is to reduce the resistance and durability
of plastic materials. It is frequently required to add hydrophilic
functional groups to plastic surfaces to promote microbe adherence

because plastics are naturally hydrophobic in nature [25]. The
polymers are used by microbes as their main source of carbon as
they attach to the polymer’s surface and keep multiplying. Next
is the depolymerization process known as “biofragmentation,”
extracellular enzymes and bacterially generated free radicals
catalyze the breakdown of biodegraded polymers into smaller
pieces [26]. Next step is assimilation in which the biofragmented
smaller molecular weight compounds are then transported into
the microbial cytoplasm [27,28]. The last step is mineralization,
which involves the successful delivery of these plastic derivatives
into cells and a sequence of enzymatic reactions that cause them
to completely decompose into oxidized metabolites including CO2,
N2, CH4, and H2O [29]. Numerous enzyme activities, including
peroxidases, lipases, esterase, cutinase, and laccase, are necessary
for the complete mineralization process [30].
3. FUNGAL STRAINS INVOLVED IN BIODEGRADATION
The world’s fungus species range from 2.2 to 3.8 million from
harmless free-living bacteria to dangerous diseases that may survive in
a variety of host and environmental niches such soil, water, plants, and
animals [31]. Fungi vary in their morphology and can be unicellular,
filamentous or dimorphic [32]. They can exist independently or in
mutualistic symbiotic relationships or as parasitic pathogens of diverse
plants and animals, including humans [33,34]. Numerous fungi inhabit
terrestrial, freshwater, and aquatic habitats [35-37].
Numerous fungi species have been found to be able to degrade a
wide range of plastic polymers due to their potential to use these
synthetic polymers as their primary or only source of energy. In
this context, it has been demonstrated that a vast variety of fungi,
representing different classes, ecologies, and morphologies, are
capable of degrading plastics. Due to its enormous advantage over
chemical and physical degradation approaches, the biodegradation
of these man-made compounds by microorganisms seems to
be one of the important techniques to control the problem of

plastic waste [38]. Biological degradation is thought to be a more
effective and strong solution to this global issue. Biodegradation
involves many kinds of plastic degrading microorganisms [39,40].
Many chemicals are transformed into simpler compounds by
microorganisms through biochemical processes. An indicator of
the biodegradation of plastic polymers is a change in the physical
properties of the polymers, such as a reduction in molecular weight,
a loss of mechanical strength, or a change in the surface properties
of the plastic [29] [Figure 2].
A. clavatus isolated from landfill soil has been found to
degrade LDPE [16]. There are numerous Aspergillus species, including
Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus sydowii, Aspergillus tubingensis,
Aspergillus fumigates isolated from Mangrove dumpsite. The coastal
environment of the Gulf of Mannar and seawater is known to degrade
polyethylene effectively [18,41,42]. Various fungal strains have been
discovered so far and showing degradation of different types of plastic
in an accomplished way. Various fungal strains isolated from different
habitats and degrading different types of plastics have been reported
worldwide [Table 1].
4. ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES
To measure the degree of plastic biodegradation, a variety of
assessment techniques have been used. Previously, the gravimetric
assessment of polymer weight/mass loss over time when exposed to
cultured microbes was the most widely used method for assessing
plastic biodegradation [49,50]. Although nowadays, various new
assessment methodologies are currently being employed to assess
the level of plastic biodegradation. Scanning electron microscopy

(SEM), which creates a surface image by illuminating a surface
with a high-intensity electron beam and scanning across it. High
magnification and hence good resolution are provided by SEM at the
nanoscale range. SEM observations are utilized to study and evaluate
the colonization of plastic films or particles by microorganisms and
at the same time visualizing fractures, trenches, and deformations
on the plastic surface [51,52], Which can indicate if the polymer is
damaged. SEM has been used in a number of studies to examine
fungi on polymers. SEM is a fast technique for observing surface
attachment and morphological microstructures [38]. Atomic force
microscopy (AFM) is another technique that can be used to identify
surface alteration of polymers during degradation [53]. Using this
method, topographical changes at the polymer surface, such as
the emergence of pits and crevices, the adhesion of microbes to
the polymer surface, and an increase in surface roughness, can be
directly observed [54].
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is used to identify
functional groups contained in polymer films. FTIR spectrum detects
and semi-quantifies changes in initial polymer arrangement, such
as the addition of carbonyl groups during oxidation [55,56]. The
crystallinity of polymer films was measured using X-ray diffraction
examination. It was carried out using an X-ray diffractometer. By
examining the diffraction patterns produced by polymer films, the
structure of such films was discovered [57]. Due to their high water
content, hydrophilic surfaces have higher surface energies and yield
smaller contact angles with water. As a result, polar functional groups
that develop in polymers as a result of environmental degradation
cause the contact angle to decrease. The rate of disintegration is
further accelerated by increased hydrophilicity because it encourages

microbe adhesion to the polymer surface [58]. Differential scanning
calorimetry is a method for carrying out thermal analysis (DSC).
Its analysis provides capacity to track phase transitions, solid state
transformations, and thermodynamic parameters during controlled
sample heating and cooling. DSC analysis can be used to measure a
variety of characteristics, including the glass transition temperature,
crystallization temperature, melting temperature, polymer crystallinity
percentage, specific heat capacity, transformation enthalpy, and many
others [59]. Evolution of CO2 is typically taken into account as a sign
of biological decay [14,56]. By monitoring the CO2 released during
biotic or abiotic mineralization in a controlled setting, the rate of
polymer degradation can be estimated [61-63].
The oligomeric fraction produced during polymer breakdown or the
detection of low-molecular-weight metabolites can also be studied
using gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection
(GC-FID) or mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [64-66]. Another
chromatographic method utilized for the examination of complex
oligomeric mixtures created during biodegradation is LC-MS [66].

Gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) is used to quantify molar
mass and molecular weight shifts [67,68]. High-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) is also used to identify certain homologues
of low-molecular-weight polymers [69].
5. APPLICATIONS
In general, fungi are more effective in degrading polymers than bacteria
because they can stick to the hydrophobic surfaces of polymers, produce
extracellular enzymes that target insoluble fibers, and endure challenging
growth environments [24,70,71]. Fungi produce a wide range of
enzymes that have the potential to break down the chemical bonds of
the plastic polymers [72]. According to a study, enzymes called laccases
from fungi like Aspergillus flavus and Pleurotus ostreatus significantly
degraded polyethylene [73,74]. According to another study, PS can
be broken down by an extracellular esterase from Lentinus tigrinus
[75]. Serine and cysteine hydrolase from Pestalotiopsis microspore
was shown in another investigation to be active in degrading PU [76].
The breakdown of lignin is frequently correlated with the enzymes

67

manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) [77]. Several
compounds converted into oxidized or polymerized products by these
enzymes, which catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions [78]. Numerous
fungi species, including Humicola insolens, Penicillium citrinum, and
Fusarium oxysporum, produce enzymes such as polyesterase, cutinase,
and hydrolase that are effective PET degraders [79-81]. Another study
showed that F. solani was converted to terephthalic acid (TPA) from a
hydrolyzed PET collection through a cutinase [82].

10. ETHICAL APPROVALS

6. CONCLUSION

12. PUBLISHER’S NOTE

Several fungal microbes have the ability to breakdown the plastic
polymer under the right conditions. The capacity of various fungal
species can cause chemical and physical changes in various plastic
polymers such as LDPE, HDPE, PET, PS, and others. Biodeterioration
(Adhesion and colonization of microbes on the surface),
biofragmentation (fragmentation of plastic polymer into monomer),
assimilation (transport into microbial cytoplasm), and mineralization
(enzymatic reactions that result in the breakdown into various oxidized
metabolites such as CO2, N2, CH4, and H2O) are the four stages of
biodegradation of plastic by fungal strains. Microbiological activities
that use enzymes including peroxidases, lipases, esterase, cutinase, and
laccase to catalyze plastic breakdown are growing as an environmental
sustainable alternative to physicochemical depolymerization.
Biodegradation, on the other hand, has a significant downside in terms
of rate of degradation. Future research will put a lot of emphasis on the
biological systems or biodegradation mechanism that are accountable
for the detected chemical and physical change. With more efficient
degradation on plastic polymer, it is important to identify novel fungal
strains. The primary goal of upcoming study will be to understand and
identify the biological systems that appear to be causing the apparent
chemical and physical damage. Only few enzymes of a fungal origin
have been associated to polymer breakdown thus far. However, these
enzymes’ biochemical and structural features have received little
attention. These details are necessary to comprehend the mechanisms
underlying the biodegradation of resistant polymers. This knowledge
will be useful for creating novel biodegradable plastic polymers,
designing microbial cell factories with improved breakdown efficiency,
and genetically altering enzymes through protein engineering. The
goal is to isolate and discover potent microbial consortia directly from
plastic contamination locations, as well as purify potent microbial
enzymes for commercial usage and increase catalytic activity through
genetic engineering.
