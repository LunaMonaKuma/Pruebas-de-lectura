Abstract A variety of biodegradable polyesters have
been developed in order to obtain useful biomaterials and
to reduce the impact of environmental pollution caused by
the large-scale accumulation of non-degradable waste
plastics. Polyhydroxyalkanoates, poly(e-caprolactone),
poly(l-lactide), and both aliphatic and aromatic polyalkylene dicarboxylic acids are examples of biodegradable
polyesters. In general, most aliphatic polyesters are
readily mineralized by a number of aerobic and anaerobic
microorganisms that are widely distributed in nature.
However, aromatic polyesters are more resistant to
microbial attack than aliphatic polyesters. The fungal
biomass in soils generally exceeds the bacterial biomass
and thus it is likely that fungi may play a considerable
role in degrading polyesters, just as they predominantly
perform the decomposition of organic matter in the soil
ecosystem. However, in contrast to bacterial polyester
degradation, which has been extensively investigated, the
microbiological and environmental aspects of fungal
degradation of polyesters are unclear. This review reports
recent advances in our knowledge of the fungal degradation of microbial and synthetic polyesters and discusses
the ecological importance and contribution of fungi in the
biological recycling of waste polymeric materials in the
biosphere.

Introduction
Nowadays, a wide variety of petroleum-based synthetic
polymers are produced worldwide to the extent of
approximately 140 million tonnes/year and remarkable
amounts of these polymers are introduced in the ecosystem as industrial waste products (Shimao 2001). However, the majority of synthetic polymers are extremely

resistant to microbial attack, due to their excessive
molecular mass, high number of aromatic rings, unusual
bonds, or halogen substitutions (Alexander 1981). For this
reason, the large-scale accumulation of waste plastics in
the biosphere has given rise to the problem of severe
environmental pollution.
Over the past three decades, a great deal of intensive
effort has been spent upon the preparation of environmentally friendly polymers, which can be easily degraded
by microorganisms. As a result, many types of aliphatic
polyesters, including polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs),
poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL), and poly(l-lactide) (PLA),
have been developed as biologically recyclable green
polymers (Scott 2000; Mller et al. 2001; Shimao 2001).
Generally, the extent of polymer biodegradation in an
ecosystem is affected by material processing, the inherent
characteristics of the substrate to be degraded, and various
microbiological and environmental factors (Brandl et al.
1995). These factors are all interdependent.
Up to this time, many reports on the bacterial
degradation of microbial and synthetic polyesters in the
environment have been published. However, reports on
the fungal degradation of these polyesters and the related
hydrolytic enzymes are relatively rare and not well
documented. Considering that fungi play a significant role
in degrading natural organic substances in the ecosystem,
such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, the fungal
contribution to the biodegradation of polyesters in the
environment should be recognized along with the bacterial degradation of polyesters. In this paper, recent
progress in our knowledge of the fungal degradation of
biodegradable polyesters is reviewed.

Biodegradation of microbial polyesters
Polyhydroxyalkanoates
PHAs are versatile polyesters produced by numerous
bacterial species as intracellular storage compounds of
carbon and energy. PHAs are currently divided into two

301

groups, short-chain-length (SCL)-PHAs and mediumchain-length (MCL)-PHAs, according to the carbonchain-length of the constituents. SCL-PHAs consist of
(R)-hydroxyalkanoates of C3–C5, while MCL-PHAs are
comprised of aliphatic and/or aromatic (R)-hydroxyalkanoates of C6–C14. SCL-PHAs are thermoplastics with a
high degree of crystallinity, while MCL-PHAs are
elastomeric or tacky materials with properties that vary
according to their composition (Madison and Huisman
1999). Poly(b-l-malic acid) (PMA) is a soluble anionic
biopolyester produced only by eukaryotic microorganisms (Shimada et al. 1969; Holler et al. 1992; Liu and
Steinbchel 1996), which is now classified as a PHA due
to its chemical structure (Steinbchel and Valentin 1995).
Recently, Steinbchel (2001) reported that approximately
150 hydroxyalkanoates, detected as constituents of PHAs,
are produced by microorganisms grown with carbon
sources containing different types of chemical structures.
Besides PHAs and PMA, the other types of polyester
found in living organisms are cutin and suberin, which are
water-insoluble polymeric materials occurring in higher
plants (Kolattukudy 2001).
Studies on the bacterial degradation of PHAs have
been intensively conducted and are well documented by
several researchers (Brandle et al. 1995; Jendrossek et al.
1996). However, the metabolic capability to hydrolyze
PHA is not restricted to bacteria; and many filamentous
fungi and yeasts capable of degrading poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and its copolyesters with 3-hydroxyvalerate [poly(3HB-co-3HV)] have been isolated from
various environments. Neumeier (1994) described a list of
the taxa of PHA-degrading fungi isolated from soil and
marine environments. Of the 95 genera listed, the
overwhelming majority (97%) were members of the
division Amastigomycota. Of these, the Basidiomycotina,
Deuteromycotina, and Ascomycotina accounted for 48%,
27%, and 19% of the total, respectively; and the
Zygomycotina accounted for only 2%, which indicates
that higher fungi are the predominant degraders of PHAs
in the environment. Until now, however, the occurrence
of MCL-PHA-degrading fungi in the environment has
been uncertain. Recently, an attempt to examine the
distribution and diversity of MCL-PHA-degrading microorganisms in various soil samples was made by Nam et
al. (2002). Approximately 60 different species belonging
to 13 genera were isolated as MCL-PHA degraders, but
the authors failed to isolate any MCL-PHA-degrading
fungus.
Most studies on the environmental degradation of
PHAs have shown that fungi belonging to the group,
Deuteromycota, including mainly Aspergillus spp and
Penicillium spp, contribute considerably to PHA breakdown in the biological system (Table 1). Apparently, a
number of mesophilic fungi belonging to the genera
Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Paecilomyces are primarily
responsible for degrading PHAs in soil and aquatic
environments (Matavulj and Molitoris 1992; Mergaert et
al. 1993, 1995; Kim et al. 2000c; Sang et al. 2002). In
addition to mesophiles, many thermotolerant A. fumigatus

strains that are capable of degrading PHB and poly(3HBco-3HV) at high temperatures (above 40 C) have been
isolated from soil samples (Mergaert et al. 1993; Kim et
al. 2000c) and compost (Mergaert et al. 1994). Recently,
the fungal degradation of BIOPOL under a simulated
deep-sea environment was investigated using the two
deep-sea isolates of a filamentous fungus, A. ustus, and a
yeast, Rhodosporidium spaerocarpum (Gonda et al.
2000). In that case, the marine isolate, A. ustus, efficiently
disintegrated BIOPOL under a hydrostatic pressure of
20 MPa, while polymer degradation under a hydrostatic
pressure of 30 MPa was significantly low. No fungal
hydrolysis of the polymer occurred at hydrostatic pressures above 30 MPa, which indicates that increasing the
hydrostatic pressure retards both polymer degradation and
the metabolic activity of the A. ustus strain.
Biochemical properties of fungal PHB depolymerases
Extracellular PHA depolymerases are a class of serine
hydrolases which are susceptible to serine esterase
inhibitors, such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)
and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). Extracellular
PHA depolymerases are divided into two classes based
on their substrate specificity. One group contains the
SCL-PHA depolymerases, which degrade only PHB and
its copolyesters with 3HV or 4HB. The other group is
composed of MCL-PHA depolymerases, which primarily
decompose the aliphatic and aromatic PHAs consisting of
3-hydroxyalkanoates of C6–C14. The great majority of
PHA-degrading microorganisms are known to produce
only one type of PHA depolymerase, which acts upon
either the SCL-PHAs or the MCL-PHAs (Jendrossek
1998, 2001).
Until now, more than 80 extracellular PHA depolymerases from prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms
have been purified and characterized (Jendrossek 2001).
However, most PHA depolymerases are prokaryotic
enzymes and are specific for only SCL-PHAs. During
the past decade, several bacterial MCL-PHA depolymerases exhibiting broad substrate specificities for structurally different aliphatic and aromatic MCL-PHAs were
isolated and biochemically characterized (Schirmer et al.
1993; Kim et al. 2000a, 2000b, 2002a). However, there is
no report on the isolation of a fungal MCL-PHA
depolymerase.
Since Brucato and Wong (1991) purified PHB depolymerase from Penicillium funiculosum as the first eukaryotic enzyme, eight distinct fungal PHB depolymerases
have been isolated from different filamentous fungi
(Table 2). Nevertheless, there is no report on the
preparation of PHA depolymerase from yeast. Fungal
PHB depolymerases share several properties among these
enzymes; and certain enzyme properties are very similar
to those with bacterial origins. However, fungal depolymerases also show some particular characteristics, which
are distinct from the common properties of bacterial PHB
depolymerases. The following descriptions indicate the

This enzyme shows the highest esterase activity for the corresponding PNP-alkanoate

characteristics that are common among the fungal
depolymerases:
1. PHB depolymerases consist of one single polypeptide
chain with a molecular mass (Mr) ranging over 33.0–
57.0 kDa.

2. In contrast to the general property of bacterial PHB
depolymerases, fungal hydrolases possess an acidic or
neutral pI value. It has been also demonstrated that
some bacterial SCL- and MCL-PHA depolymerases
have an acidic pI value (Kita et al. 1995; Kim et al.
2000b, 2002a).

304

3. The fungal PHB depolymerases are most likely
glycoproteins.
4. Fungal enzymes are susceptible to DFP or PMSF,
which is a serine esterase inhibitor, as shown in the
cases of bacterial PHA depolymerases.
5. Fungal PHB hydrolases are very sensitive to dithiothreitol, indicating that the disulfide bridges in the
active sites play an essential role in the formation of
the tertiary structure of the enzymes. Similar effects
are also found in most bacterial SCL-PHA depolymerases, while the MCL-PHA depolymerases from
Pseudomonasspp are not inactivated by this inhibitor
(Schirmer et al. 1993; Kim et al. 2000b, 2002a).
6. Fungal PHB depolymerases do not hydrolyze tributyrin, olive oil, or p-nitrophenylpalmitate, which are
substrates for lipases.

or PCL. In particular, the hydrolytic enzyme from A.
fumigatus efficiently degrades bacterial and synthetic
polyesters in the following order: PEA >PES >PBA
>PHB >PHV. The extracellular PHB depolymerases
showing a broad substrate specificity towards PHB,
PHV, and poly(3HB-co-3HV) were also prepared from
cultures of A. fumigatus Pdf1 (Iyer et al. 2000) and P.
funiculosum IFO 6345 (Miyazaki et al. 2000). The
enzymatic degradation of PHB by fungal PHB depolymerases usually results in the formation of 3-hydroxybutyrate and its dimers as the final hydrolysis products (Oda
et al. 1995; Scherer 1996; Iyer et al. 2000; Kim et al.
2002b).

Recently, Miyazaki et al. (2000) reported that the PHB
depolymerase from Penicillium funiculosum IFO6345
contained a lipase box sequence (GLSSG) in the Nterminus of the protein, suggesting that the catalytic
domain is probably located in this area. Considering that
the catalytic domain and the substrate-binding domain of
all the PHB depolymerases investigated constitute the Nterminus and C-terminus of the enzymes, respectively, it
is believed that the composite structure of fungal PHB
depolymerases also corresponds to one of the composite
structures of the bacterial PHB depolymerases (Jendrossek 1998). However, there is still a need to clarify
the apparent composite structure of the fungal enzymes
via molecular characterization of the PHB depolymerase
genes. In contrast, MCL-PHA depolymerases consist of a
substrate-binding domain in the N-terminus and a catalytic domain in the C-terminus (Schirmer and Jendrossek
1994; Kim et al. 2002c).
The majority of bacterial PHB depolymerases exhibit a
pH optimum in the alkaline range of pH 7.5–9.8
(Jendrossek 2001). Similarly, it has been also reported
that PHB depolymerases from Emericellopsis minima
(Kim et al. 2002b) and two A. fumigatus species (Scherer
1996; Iyer et al. 2000) are alkaline enzymes, showing a
maximum activity at pH 8.0–9.0. However, all PHB
depolymerases from Penicillium spp are most active in
the acidic range of pH 5.0–6.5, as shown in Table 2. The
PHB depolymerase from A. fumigatus M2A is a thermotolerant enzyme, with an optimum temperature of 70 C,
while all the other fungal enzymes exhibited their highest
activity at 45–60 C.
Compared with many bacterial PHB depolymerases,
some fungal PHB depolymerases are known as relatively
nonspecific hydrolases that are capable of giving rise to
chain scission, acting upon various types of polymer
substrates. For example, the PHB hydrolase from A.
fumigatus M2A catalyzes synthetic polyesters, such as
polyethylene adipate (PEA), polyethylene succinate
(PES), and polybutylene adipate (PBA), in addition to
poly(3HB-co-3HV) and poly(3HB-co-4HB) over the
entire range of compositions (Scherer et al. 1999).
However, it does not decompose PLA, polyvalerolactone,

The extracellular PMA hydrolase from the slime mold
Physarum polycephalum was recently isolated and characterized (Korherr et al. 1995; Karl and Holler 1998).
However, it was assumed that this enzyme is excreted
from the plasmodia of P. polycephalum under unfavorable environmental conditions (Korherr et al. 1995). The
PMA depolymerase does not degrade PHB, which is the
reduced form of PMA. It is a glycoprotein with a Mr
of 97,000 and exists in multiple forms. In particular, in
contrast to the general properties of PHB depolymerases,
it is neither a metallo- nor a serine-hydrolase and is most
active at pH 3.5. Although the extracellular PMA
hydrolase from Comamonas acidovorans was recently
purified (Gdde et al. 1999), any extracellular PMA
depolymerase from non-PMA-producing eukaryotic organisms has not yet been isolated.

Characterization of fungal PMA hydrolase

Biodegradation of synthetic polyesters
Poly(e-caprolactone)
PCL, a synthetic linear polyester with an almost 50%
crystallinity, is biologically degradable and consists of 6hydroxyhexanoates. Generally, the environmental degradation of PCL appears to occur by the action of bacteria
that are widely distributed in the ecosystem (Nishida and
Tokiwa 1993; Mergaert and Swings 1996; Suyama et al.
1998). However, several studies have shown that some
filamentous fungi and yeasts also hydrolyze PCL to
water-soluble products, as listed in Table 1, although little
regarding their PCL depolymerases is known. Fields et al.
(1974) reported that Aureobasidium pullulans (formerly
Pulllularia pullulans) can efficiently degrade a lower
molecular weight (Mw) PCL film (Mw=1,250), but the
extent of decomposition of a PCL film with a Mw above
15,000 by the fungus was negligible. In contrast, Penicillium sp. strain 14-3 (Tokiwa et al. 1976) and a yeast,
Cryptococcus laurentii (Benedict et al. 1983b), degrade
PCLs with relatively higher Mws (25,000 and 35,000,
respectively). Another study showed that Aspergillus
fischeri, A. flavus, Penicillium funiculosum, Chaetomium

305

globosum, and a Fusarium sp. could metabolize PCLs
with Mws in the range 7,130–35,000 (Benedict et al.
1983a). However, in that case, increasing the Mw of the
polyester reduced its degradability. Recently, Sanchez et
al. (2000) reported the breakdown of a high Mw PCL
(Mw=67,300) at 50 C by a thermotolerant A. fumigatus
ST-01 and a thermophilic Thermoascus aurantiacus.
These results suggest that one of the most important
factors influencing PCL biodegradation is the PCLdegrading microorganisms that produce different types
of PCL hydrolases, even though the biodegradability of a
polymer is related to its Mw.
Tokiwa and Suzuki (1977b) showed that various
esterases and lipases could hydrolyze PCL. In particular,
the lipases of Rhizopus delemar (Tokiwa and Suzuki
1977b) and R. arrhizus (Tokiwa et al. 1986) could readily
hydrolyze synthetic polyesters such as PCL, poly(ethylene dicarboxylic acids), and poly(butylene dicarboxylic
acids). However, PCL is not susceptible to bacterial
(Jaeger et al. 1995) and fungal PHB depolymerases (Oda
et al. 1995; Kim et al. 2002b). Some fungal phytopathogens belonging to Fusarium spp can produce
cutinase to degrade a cutin polyester that is the structural
component of a plant cuticle (Baker and Bateman 1978).
There is some evidence suggesting that the Fusarium PCL
depolymerases are true cutinases. Murphy et al. (1996)
reported that a cutinase-negative gene-replacement mutant of F. solani did not degrade both PCL and cutin,
while the wild-type strains of Fusarium spp commonly
hydrolyzed both polyesters. The production of PCL
depolymerase in the wild-type strains was induced by
adding the cutinase inducer, 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic
acid, to the culture medium in addition to the PCL
hydrolysates. In contrast, no PCL depolymerase was
induced in the cutinase-negative mutant by the same
inducers. Another study showed that the cutinase-negative
mutant of F. solani produces a second PCL depolymerase,
which can be induced by Tween 80 and tributyrin, but not
by PCL or cutin, suggesting that the enzyme is a lipase
distinct from cutinase (Murphy et al. 1998). The fungal
degradation of the plant polyesters (cutin, suberin) is well
documented by Kolattukudy (2001).
Poly(l-lactide)
PLA is a biocompatible thermoplastic with a melting
temperature of 175 C and a glass transition temperature
of 60 C and is synthesized by the polymerization of llactic acid. Originally, Williams (1981) reported the
biodegradability of PLA by the lipase from R. delemar
and the proteinase K from Tritirachium album. PLA can
also be hydrolyzed by the polyester polyurethane depolymerase from Comamonas acidovorans (Akutsu et al.
1998). However, it is currently believed that PLA is more
resistant to microbial attack in the environment than other
microbial and synthetic polyesters (Suyama et al. 1998).
In fact, reports on the environmental degradation of PLA
by microorganisms are relatively rare and most PLA-

degraders isolated to date are restricted to actinomycetes
belonging to the genus Amycolatopsis (Pranamuda et al.
1997; Ikura and Kudo 1999; Pranamuda and Tokiwa
1999; Nakamura et al. 2001), although the breakdown of
the polymer by Bacillus brevis (Tomita et al. 1999) and
some unidentified fungal strains (Torres et al. 1996) has
been reported.
The attempt to screen PLA-degrading fungi was first
conducted by Torres et al. (1996). They demonstrated
that, of the 14 fungal strains tested, only two strains of F.
moniliforme and P. roqueforti could assimilate dl-lactic
acid and the partially soluble racemic oligomers
(Mw=1,000), which are PLA derivatives. In particular,
they observed that one strain of F. moniliforme was able
to grow on a poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) copolyester (Mw=150,000) film, but its ability to mineralize the
polymer was relatively poor. Apparently, Tritirachium
album ATCC 22563 is the only PLA-degrading fungus
that has been identified to date (Jarerat and Tokiwa
2001a). In that case, the PLA degradation rate by T.
album was greatly increased by adding 0.1% gelatin to the
culture medium, implying that gelatin induces the
production of a protease capable of giving rise to chain
scission of the PLA. In fact, the culture supernatant of T.
album exhibited hydrolytic activity towards silk fibroin
and elastin in addition to PLA, but not towards PHB,
PCL, and polybutylene succinate (PBS). From these
results, it was concluded that the hydrolase from T. album
might be a protease rather than a lipase. Similarly, Oda et
al. (2000) reported that various commercial prokaryotic
and eukaryotic proteases exhibited hydrolytic activity
against PLA.
Aliphatic polyalkylene dicarboxylic acids
A variety of aliphatic polyesters consisting of dicarboxylic acid units, such as PEA, PES, polypropylene
adipate (PPA), PBA, PBS, and polyhexylene carbonate,
have been widely produced commercially. Several studies
have proven the biodegradability of these synthetic
polyesters, either by measuring microbial growth on an
agar plate containing the respective emulsified polymer
substrate (Pranamuda et al. 1995; Suyama et al. 1998;
Tansengco and Tokiwa 1998; Jarerat and Tokiwa 2001a,
2001b), or by enzymatic degradation tests using fungal
hydrolases, such as lipase (Tokiwa and Suzuki 1977b;
Tokiwa et al. 1986; Walter et al. 1995), PEA depolymerase (Tokiwa and Suzuki 1977a), and PHB depolymerase (Scherer et al. 1999).
From the fungal degradation studies of low Mw PEA,
PPA, and PBA, Darby and Kaplan (1968) reported that
several filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus flavus, A.
niger, A. versicolor, Aureobasidium pullulans, P. funiculosum, and Chaetomium globosum, can hydrolyze the
polyesters. However, increasing the Mw and hydrocarbon
content in the polymers consisting of dicarboxylic acid
units reduces their biodegradability. In an early study, the
PEA-degrading enzyme from Penicillium sp. strain 14-3

306

was purified and characterized (Tokiwa and Suzuki
1977a). The enzyme, with a Mr of 25,000, exhibited its
highest activity at pH 4.5 and 45 C and was remarkably
activated by divalent cations, such as Ca2+ and Cd2+. It
was assumed that this fungal PEA depolymerase is a
lipase exhibiting a broad substrate specificity capable of
acting upon various bio- and synthetic polymers. This
means it can degrade not only the substrates for lipase,
such as plant oils, triglycerides, and the methyl esters of
fatty acids, but also the aliphatic polyesters composed of
dicarboxylic acids. However, it does not degrade aromatic
polyesters, such as polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene tetrachlorophthalate. In addition, the non-specific hydrolysis of microbial and synthetic polyesters was
observed in the case of the hydrolase from Aspergillus
fumigatus M2A (Scherer et al. 1999). Even though the
fungal enzyme was referred as a PHB depolymerase, it
showed its highest hydrolytic activity for PEA and
degraded PES and PBA more efficiently than PHB.
Aromatic polyalkylene dicarboxylic acids
Compared with most aliphatic polyesters, aromatic
polyesters, such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) and
poly(butylene terephthalate), have excellent material
properties. However, it is now considered that their
susceptibility to microbial attack is negligible (Mller et
al. 2001), although some growth of A. niger on the
surfaces of some aromatic polyesters has been observed
(Huang and Byrne 1980). Therefore, to increase the
biodegradability of aromatic polyesters, recent studies
focused on the synthesis of aliphatic–aromatic copolyesters (Mller et al. 2001; Ki and Park 2001). In fact, it was
reported that the incorporation of aliphatic dicarboxylic
acids or polyethylene glycol in polyester chains greatly
enhances the degradation rate by the lipase from R.
delemar (Nagata et al. 1997). To date, some bacterial
species capable of decomposing aliphatic–aromatic
polyalkylene dicarboxylic acid copolyesters with different
compositions have been isolated from composts (Kleeberg et al. 1998). However, little is known about the
fungal strains that can cause the environmental degradation of these polymers.
Microbiological and environmental aspects
of the fungal degradation of polyesters
In soil systems, the fungal biomass generally exceeds the
bacterial biomass (Killham 1994). Therefore, the fungal
contribution to the biological recycling of organic
substances in the environment is expected to be much
greater than the bacterial contribution. Actually, it was
reported that the decomposition of organic matter in
acidic soils is predominantly achieved by fungal strains
exhibiting a greater tolerance to acid conditions, compared with bacterial heterotrophs (Killham 1994). In a
study on the relative contributions of fungi and bacteria to

cellulase activities in soil, Rhee et al. (1987) indicated
that fungi are the dominant contributors to the degradation of cellulosic materials in a soil ecosystem. Recently,
Sang et al. (2002) estimated the relative contributions
made by fungi, actinomycetes, and bacteria to the in situ
biodegradation of a microbial polyester film in soil. They
compared the degradation abilities and population of
poly(3HB-co-3HV)-degrading fungi with those of bacteria and actinomycetes and found not only that the
population of fungi dramatically increased during
poly(3HB-co-3HV) film degradation but also that the
degradation rate of the fungi was much higher than that of
either the actinomycetes or the bacteria. On the basis of
these descriptions, it is believed that many fungal strains
may play a considerable role in decomposing various
polymeric materials in soil systems.
Composting is a microbial process that is regarded to
be one of the most promising technologies for the
biological management of solid wastes. As the temperature rises during the active composting stage, thermophilic
heterotrophs
replace
mesophilic
forms.
Mineralization of the various types of aliphatic polyesters
by thermotolerant or thermophilic bacteria in the composting process has been extensively investigated (Mergaert et al. 1994; Tansengco and Tokiwa 1998; Jarerat
and Tokiwa 2001b; Sakai et al. 2001). In contrast, the
ecological importance of fungi participating in the
thermophilic biodegradation of polyesters is not well
understood. This is despite the fact that a few polyesterdegrading thermotolerant or thermophilic fungi have been
isolated from soil and compost (Mergaert et al. 1994;
Sanchez et al. 2000).
Currently, the annual worldwide use of plastic materials is gradually increasing and, for this reason, the
importance of both developing and improving a technology for the eco-friendly management of waste plastic
materials is greatly emphasized. From this point of view,
it is expected that a more intensive study on the fungal
degradation of polyesters will not only emphasize the
ecological significance of fungi, but also contribute to the
development of a more efficient strategy for the biological treatment of wastes. In addition, further advances in
biochemistry and molecular genetics concerning fungal
enzymes catalyzing the degradation of the polyesters will
open up new fields in environmental biotechnology and
bioengineering for fine chemicals.
