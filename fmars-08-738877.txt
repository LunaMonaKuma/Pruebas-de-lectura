The Potential Role of Marine Fungi
in Plastic Degradation – A Review.

Plastic debris has been accumulating in the marine realm since the start of plastic mass
production in the 1950s. Due to the adverse effects on ocean life, the fate of plastics
in the marine environment is an increasingly important environmental issue. Microbial
degradation, in addition to weathering, has been identified as a potentially relevant
breakdown route for marine plastic debris. Although many studies have focused on
microbial colonization and the potential role of microorganisms in breaking down marine
plastic debris, little is known about fungi-plastic interactions. Marine fungi are a generally
understudied group of microorganisms but the ability of terrestrial and lacustrine fungal
taxa to metabolize recalcitrant compounds, pollutants, and some plastic types (e.g.,
lignin, solvents, pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polyurethane, and polyethylene)
indicates that marine fungi could be important degraders of complex organic matter in
the marine realm, too. Indeed, recent studies demonstrated that some fungal strains
from the ocean, such as Zalerion maritimum have the ability to degrade polyethylene.
This mini-review summarizes the available information on plastic-fungi interactions in
marine environments. We address (i) the currently known diversity of fungi colonizing
marine plastic debris and provide (ii) an overview of methods applied to investigate the
role of fungi in plastic degradation, highlighting their advantages and drawbacks. We
also highlight (iii) the underestimated role of fungi as plastic degraders in marine habitats.

OCEAN PLASTIC POLLUTION
Plastics are man-made materials of mostly petrochemical origin – so-called conventional plastics
that are commonly considered as non-biodegradable (Wayman and Niemann, 2021). Most
conventional plastics comprise a carbon-carbon backbone, e.g., polyethylene (PE), polypropylene
(PP) and polystyrene (PS), while other plastics feature heteroatoms, e.g., polyethylene terephthalate

(PET), polyurethane (PU) or polyamides (PA, Nylon).
Conventional plastics are used in nearly all industrial sectors,
most importantly packaging, construction and transport. The
global annual production of plastics reached 359 Mt in 2018
(PlasticsEurope, 2020). Recently, biopolymer alternatives, based
on renewable sources (e.g., starch and cellulose) have been
developed, but their global market share is still small. In 2020, the
global production of bioplastics amounted to approximately 2 Mt
(Bioplastics Market Data update, 2020). Among the plastic types
produced from renewable carbon sources, approximately half are
biodegradable, while the second half is non-biodegradable.
A substantial fraction of plastic waste is mismanaged (Geyer
et al., 2017), and it has been estimated that this fraction
represented an average of 80 Mt (60 to 99 Mt) accumulated
in total (Lebreton and Andrady, 2019). Mismanaged plastic
waste ends up in all ecosystem compartments, such as soils
(Chae and An, 2018), lakes (Mason et al., 2016) and rivers
(Lebreton et al., 2017). Thus, freshwater bodies function as
a transport vector for plastic ultimately reaching the ocean
though the magnitude of this transport mechanism is discussed
controversially (Weiss et al., 2021). In addition, plastic litter can
be airborne, thus, the atmospheric deposition of plastic litter is a
potentially important source for the ocean’s plastic budget (Liss,
2020). Indeed, plastic litter has emerged as a major pollution
issue in marine environments (Eriksen et al., 2014; UNEP, 2014;
van Sebille et al., 2015; Wayman and Niemann, 2021). Plastic
debris forms the most abundant component of marine litter,
accounting for up to 95% of waste found on shorelines, ocean
surface water and the seafloor (Galgani et al., 2015). In fact,
sedimented plastic litter might become a stratigraphic marker
horizon of the Anthropocene epoch (Zalasiewicz et al., 2016).
It has been estimated that 0.1% (Cózar et al., 2015) to up to
4.6% (Jambeck et al., 2015) of the global plastic production
enters the ocean. As a result, the total accumulated plastic waste
in the ocean might have reached 320 Mt in the year 2015
(Wayman and Niemann, 2021).
Plastic floating at the ocean surface is typically dominated
by PE and PP, roughly in accordance with global production
figures (Erni-Cassola et al., 2019). However, plastic debris in
the ocean varies in size: macroplastics (>5 mm), microplastics
(1 µm – 5 mm) and nanoplastics (<1 µm) (Wayman and
Niemann, 2021). Several studies have tried to quantify the
different size fractions to estimate the total concentration of
plastics and the fate of it in marine environments. For example,
in the Mediterranean Sea, the density of floating microplastic
was about 2.5 × 105 items per km2 (Cózar et al., 2015).
The abundance of floating plastic in the ocean is usually
determined by surface trawling with nets (typically > 300 µm
mesh size). Consequently, these methods discriminate against
smaller size classes, which could account for an important
fraction of the floating plastic budget (Poulain et al., 2019).
Furthermore, surface trawls do not account for submerged and
sedimented plastics debris (Woodall et al., 2014). Finally, the
distribution of floating plastic is not homogenous, as large
quantities concentrate in subtropical ocean gyres and enclosed
basins, making balanced sampling efforts over large areas difficult
(Lindeque et al., 2020).

MICROBIAL BIOFILMS ON MARINE
PLASTIC DEBRIS
Rapid microbial colonization occurs on any available material
that ends up in the ocean, whether it is of natural or synthetic
origin (such as plastic debris). From a microbial perspective,
transiting from pelagic to a particle-attached lifestyle provides
advantages; e.g., better access to nutrients, and protection against
UV exposure and grazing (de Carvalho, 2018). Several studies
have investigated the composition of microbial communities
living on plastic materials in different marine environments
(Zettler et al., 2013; Amaral-Zettler et al., 2015; Eich et al., 2015;
Oberbeckmann et al., 2016; Debroas et al., 2017; Dussud et al.,
2018; Ogonowski et al., 2018; Miao et al., 2019; Dudek et al., 2020;
Krause et al., 2020; Vaksmaa et al., 2021b). Some of these reported
a difference in community structure when comparing microbes
in biofilms on plastics to those in the surrounding seawater
or those attached to natural surfaces. A detailed overview of
this matter is compiled in Wright et al. (2020). However, most
studies applied amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene,
and focused on bacterial and archaeal communities in biofilms
attached to the plastic debris. In contrast, fungal community
composition on plastic in the marine environment has, until now,
been investigated seldomly (Table 1).

A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE
FUNGAL KINGDOM
The fungal kingdom constitutes a major lineage within the
domain Eukarya and diverged from a common ancestor with the
animals >800 million years ago (Parfrey et al., 2011; Chang et al.,
2015). Fungi exhibit highly diverse lifestyles and can cope with
different redox conditions. The majority of fungi seemingly prefer
oxic environments, however some fungal species inhabit oxygen
minimum zones (Stief et al., 2014). Furthermore, anaerobic
fungi (mainly studied in gut microbiomes) have been identified
(Gruninger et al., 2014; Mura et al., 2019). Morphologically,
fungi may be unicellular (e.g., yeasts and cells with a flagellum
such as zoospores), filamentous (e.g., molds and mushrooms)
or dimorphic (i.e., they exists in two forms, yeast-like single
cells or hyphae forming) (Boyce and Andrianopoulos, 2015).
They can be found as free-living organisms, in mutualistic
symbiotic associations (such as those forming mycorrhizas,
lichens, in gut microbiomes) (Watkinson, 2016) or as parasitic
pathogens of several plants and animals, including humans
(Szabo and Bushnell, 2001). Fungi are ubiquitous and occur
throughout terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments
(Sutherland, 1916; Raghukumar, 2017; Walker et al., 2017;
Gladfelter et al., 2019).
Taxonomically, nineteen major fungal phyla are
recognized: Aphelidiomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiobolomycota,
Basidiomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Calcarisporiellomycota,
Caulochytriomycota, Chytridiomycota, Entomophthoromycota,
Entorrhizomycota,
Glomeromycota,
Kickxellomycota,
Monoblepharomycota, Mortierellomycota, Mucoromycota,
Neocallimastigomycota, Olpidiomycota, Rozellomycota, and

Zoopagomycota (Wijayawardene et al., 2020). However,
the phylogeny and taxonomy of the fungal kingdom has been a
matter of debate (Hibbett et al., 2007; Spatafora et al., 2016, 2017).
Some fungal phyla are rarely sampled and our understanding
of the deeply branching groups is insufficient (Naranjo-Ortiz
and Gabaldón, 2019). Lately, the number of available fungal
genomes has been increasing. But these new data showed that
complex inter-species relationships occur, such as introgression
and hybridization (Gabaldón, 2020), that blur the definition of
a species. The estimated total number of fungal species could
range from 2 to 4 million (Hawksworth and Lücking, 2017),
but only ∼100000 have been described (Wu et al., 2019) of
which only ∼1100 species originate from marine environments
(Amend et al., 2019).
Recently, an online database, www.marinefungi.org,
containing marine fungal species was created (Jones et al.,
2019). Many fungal species are found in both, terrestrial and
marine environments (Gladfelter et al., 2019). It has been
proposed that early diverging fungi, Chytridiomycota and
Rozellomycota, originate from aquatic environments (Berbee
et al., 2017, 2020). These phyla also have members found in
the present-day ocean. On the other hand, fungi from the
Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, commonly present in
marine environments, are proposed to originate from terrestrial
ancestors. Because of this difference in origin (terrestrial vs.
aquatic), a clear definition of “marine fungus” is challenging.
The recent definition suggests that a marine fungus is “any
fungus that is recovered repeatedly from marine habitats
and: (1) is able to grow and/or sporulate (on substrata) in
marine environments; or (2) forms symbiotic relationships
with other marine organisms; or (3) is shown to adapt and
evolve at the genetic level or is metabolically active in marine
environments” (Pang et al., 2016). Marine fungi are found
ubiquitously in the ocean (Comeau et al., 2016; Tisthammer
et al., 2016; Raghukumar, 2017) including coastal environments
(Taylor and Cunliffe, 2016; Picard, 2017; Banos et al., 2020),
mangroves (Hyde and Lee, 1995; Alias et al., 2010; Pang et al.,
2010; Lee et al., 2019), the water column (Richards et al., 2015;
Tisthammer et al., 2016; Morales et al., 2019) and sediments
(Kohlmeyer and Kohlmeyer, 1979a; Khudyakova et al., 2000;

Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org

Mouton et al., 2012; Tisthammer et al., 2016). Marine fungi have
also been detected in extreme marine habitats such as the deep
sea biosphere (Orsi et al., 2013; Rédou et al., 2015), the Arctic
(Rämä et al., 2017; Hassett et al., 2019) and oxygen minimum
zones (Cathrine and Raghukumar, 2009; Jebaraj et al., 2010;
Manohar et al., 2015).
Metabolically, fungi participate in different biogeochemical
processes and occupy a plethora of ecological niches. Fungi play
a major role in decomposing recalcitrant substrates, making
them an integral part of food web structures, contributing to
carbon cycling and nutrient regeneration in, at least, terrestrial
environments. For example, saprophytic fungi accelerate carbon
and nitrogen cycling and symbiotic fungi such as mycorrhiza
networks, enhance primary production in symbionts and hosts
(Lindahl et al., 2007; Walder et al., 2012). Similar to terrestrial
systems, parasitic fungi in aquatic environments were found
to have a great impact on pelagic food webs and thus
biogeochemical cycling (Jobard et al., 2010; Sime-Ngando, 2012).
Also some symbiotic interactions are known from the marine
environment, for example, with phytoplankton seaweeds and
sponges (Rasconi et al., 2011; Richards et al., 2012; Webster
and Taylor, 2012; Du et al., 2019). Similar to terrestrial
systems, fungi in coastal and surface marine environments were
found to degrade wood (lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose)
(Bucher et al., 2004) and remains of marine animals (Kohlmeyer
and Kohlmeyer, 1979b,c; Raghukumar, 2017). Marine fungi
were furthermore found to degrade complex components
of algae such as agar (in laboratory conditions; Balabanova
et al., 2018) and fungi dominate the microbial composition
of bathypelagic marine snow where they might play the role
as saprotrophs (Bochdansky et al., 2017). Fungi contribute to
different nitrogen cycle processes such as nitrification (Falih
and Wainwright, 1995) and denitrification (Shoun et al., 1992;
Stief et al., 2014; Maeda et al., 2015) in both, terrestrial and
the marine environment (Cathrine and Raghukumar, 2009).
Marine fungi mobilize metals by excreting siderophores and
act as bio-sorbents for some metals, thereby alleviating metal
toxicity (Taboski et al., 2005; Vala, 2010). These processes
influence the cycles of several elements among them: Fe, Mn,
Hg, Ni, Zn, Ag, Cu, Cd, and Pb (Gadd, 2004). Finally, some

targeting the 18S rRNA gene (V4 and V9 regions) were able
to detect a higher number of Chytridiomycota. Some taxa
that were totally omitted by the ITS2 marker were detected,
such as Rozellomycota, Zoopagomycota, Aphelidomycota, and
Blastocladiomycota. Across all samples, the genus Aspergillus
was the most abundant. Some of its OTUs were assigned at the
species level, identifying A. vitricola, A. restricus, and A. wentii.
None of the identified strains were previously reported as plastic
degraders, although other Aspergillus species have been shown to
be able to oxidize different plastic types (Table 2). Lacerda and
colleagues also reported on fungal taxa, such as Aphelidomycota,
Zoopagomycota, Mucoromycota, and Blastocladiomycota, that
had previously not been detected to colonize plastic in the
marine environment.
In contrast to environmental studies, Kirstein et al. (2018)
studied the microbial composition formed on microplastics
under controlled laboratory conditions. Their set-up consisted
of a flow-through system with North Sea water in which HDPE
(High Density Polyethylene), LDPE (Low Density Polyethylene),
PP, PS and PET were incubated in the dark. The 18S rRNA
gene sequencing analysis of the eukaryotic community of biofilms
revealed that the highest fungal read abundances belonged
to Chytridiomycota (up to 3% of sequences on PET). This
can be explained by this taxa’s dominance throughout aquatic
environments (Comeau et al., 2016) or the compatibility of
biofilm presence on PET and chytrid’s parasitic lifestyle.

fungi break down rocks and minerals to harvest nutrients
(Ortega-Morales et al., 2016).

LIFE ON PLASTIC IS FANTASTIC:
FUNGAL COLONIZATION OF MARINE
PLASTIC DEBRIS
Fungi in Marine Environments as Part of
Marine Plastic Debris Associated
Biofilms
Marine fungi are generally understudied, which is also reflected
by the relatively limited number of studies targeting fungi
on marine plastic debris (MPD) (Jacquin et al., 2019).
Oberbeckmann et al. (2016) conducted a seasonal comparison
of microbial communities including both bacteria and fungi on
submerged PET bottles, glass slides, and seawater in the North
Sea. Fungal communities were represented by Ascomycota,
Basidiomycota and Chytridiomycota. The study showed that
the PET-attached eukaryotic communities (fungi among them)
varied significantly with season and location. Kettner et al. (2017,
2019) conducted exposure experiments with PE and PS in the
Baltic Sea and the river Warnow and investigated colonization
of these plastic surfaces by fungi. The fungal genus Chytridium,
as well as fungi-like Rhinosporideacae, Rhizidiomyces, and
Pythium taxa, had a high read count on both plastic types at
both locations. However, a substantial number of sequences
was assigned as unclassified fungi. The fungal community
composition was significantly influenced by location but not
polymer type. Furthermore, the alpha diversity was significantly
lower for PE and PS compared to the surrounding water and
wood particles. De Tender et al. (2017) conducted a 44-week
experiment during which PE plastic sheets and dolly ropes were
weighed down close to the sediment at a harbor and an offshore
location in the North Sea. Similar to the Baltic Sea studies by
Kettner et al. (2017, 2019), they found that the Ascomycota were
highly abundant followed by a smaller fraction of Basidiomycota
and Mucoromycota. Furthermore, a minor fraction of members
of Ascomycota from the Lecanoromycetes class (Physconia,
Candelariella, Caloplaca) were identified. Analyses on the
beta diversity of the fungal community composition showed
statistically significant effects of sample type (natural substrate
vs. plastic polymers), environment, and exposure time. Some
of the detected species were previously identified as potential
PE degraders in terrestrial environments: Cladosporium
cladosporioides (Bonhomme et al., 2003) and Fusarium redolens
(Albertsson, 1980; Albertsson and Karlsson, 1990).
Recently, Lacerda et al. (2020) studied the fungal diversity
associated with plastics in the surface waters of the Western
South Atlantic and the Antarctic Peninsula by investigating
three different molecular marker genes for fungal identification:
ITS2 (Internal transcribed spacer), the variable regions V4 and
V9 of the 18S rRNA gene sequence. To date, this is the only
study aiming to resolve fungal diversity on plastic using multiple
marker genes. Across the tested marker genes, a total of 64
different fungal orders were associated with plastics. The primers

Plastic Biodegradation Potential of Fungi
Biodegradation is the degradation of compounds and substrates
mediated by living organisms, most commonly microorganisms.
The soluble products of biodegradation (typically low molecular
weight compounds) are absorbed or assimilated by the
microorganisms. The biodegradation can be partial or complete.
Complete biodegradation results in the formation of CO2 and
is also referred to as biomineralization. On the other hand,
degradation of organic matter without a terminal electron
acceptor, conditions that are countered in some reduced
environments, leads to the formation of CH4 and/or other shortchain hydrocarbons. In natural environments, biodegradation is
mediated by enzymes or by other compounds (such as acids and
peroxides), secreted by microorganisms.
Fungi are able to degrade synthetic compounds; e.g., persistent
organic pollutants (POPs) (Singleton, 2001), polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Cerniglia and Sutherland, 2001), benzene,
toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX compounds) (Buswell,
2001) and pesticides (Pinto et al., 2012). The metabolic versatility
of fungi and ability to degrade complex compounds indicates
that biodegradation of plastics in the environment could be a
potential metabolic trait of some fungi (Vaksmaa et al., 2021a).
To date, some plastic degrading fungi have indeed been identified
mostly from the Ascomycete phylum to which also Aspergillus,
Fusarium, and Penicillium belong (Table 2 Fusarium sp. and
F. oxysporum isolated from soil provoked weight loss of Nylon,
PE, and PU) (Tachibana et al., 2010; Raghavendra et al., 2016).
F. solani from a collection hydrolyzed PET to terephthalic acid
(TPA) via a cutinase (Ronkvist et al., 2009). Furthermore, several
strains belonging to Penicillium are considered as potential

isolated from soil (Yamada-Onodera et al., 2001; Sowmya et al.,
2012; Ojha et al., 2017) and Penicillium sp. isolated from seawater
(Alshehrei, 2017) showed potential to degrade PE. Similar to
Penicillium, different species belonging to the genus Aspergillus
were found to be potential plastic degraders as well (Table 2).
A. flavus isolated from soil (Deepika and Madhuri, 2015), wax
moth gut (Zhang et al., 2020) and a marine environment
(Sangeetha Devi et al., 2015; Alshehrei, 2017) exhibited the
potential to degrade PE and A. niger isolated from soil (Deepika
and Madhuri, 2015; Raghavendra et al., 2016) and seawater
(Alshehrei, 2017) showed potential to degrade PE and PU. Also,
A. terreus isolated from soil (Zahra et al., 2010), mangrove
sediments (Ameen et al., 2015; Sangale et al., 2019) and seawater
(Alshehrei, 2017) were potentially able to degrade PE. In addition
to these species, several other types of Aspergillus strains were
considered as potential PE and PU degraders. Many of the
plastic degrading species that were isolated from terrestrial
environments (Table 2) are also found in marine habitats.
However, it has not been confirmed if all of the plastic degrading
strains found in terrestrial environments perform equally well in
the marine realm.
The enzymes utilized by plastic degrading fungi in the
environment are typically not constrained. However, fungi
produce a wide range of enzymes that have the potential
to break down the chemical bonds of the plastic polymers
(Figure 1). Amongst these are manganese peroxidase (MnP)
and lignin peroxidase (LiP), which are commonly associated

Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org

with lignin degradation (Xu et al., 2013). These enzymes
catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions, involving free radicals,
transforming several compounds into oxidized or polymerized
products (Wei and Zimmermann, 2017). Peroxidase are also
used in industrial applications for degrading recalcitrant organic
pollutants, PAHs, industrial dyes and chlorophenols (Qin et al.,
2014). Lignin peroxidase is characterized by a high redox
potential, and enables oxidation of non-phenolic aromatic
compounds. Another enzyme that might be involved in plastic
degradation is laccase, a multicopper oxidase, which is a well
classified lignin-modifying enzyme (Mehra et al., 2018) and
mediates the oxidation of the polymers’ carbon backbone
(Amobonye et al., 2021).
Elevated laccase, manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase
activities were observed during PE degradation by a fungal
consortium in a mangrove (Ameen et al., 2015). It appears
likely that these enzymes also play a role in potential plastic
degradation in the ocean. Marine adapted fungi have the ability
to regulate the expression of their enzymes according to salinity.
Cultivated in marine conditions, Peniophora sp., for example,
showed multigene transcription of ligninolytic laccase enzymes
(Otero et al., 2017). Fungi isolated from marine environments can
also produce enzymes that allow them to grow in liquid media
with sole carbon sources such as agar, alginate, carrageenans,
laminarians, and ulvans, i.e., polymers which are common
in the marine realm (Wang et al., 2016). However, whether
these compounds are also utilized by marine fungi in situ,
i.e., in the ocean, still needs to be shown. Similarly to several

weight/mass loss of the polymer over a specific time period
during which the plastic is exposed to an environmental
matrix or to cultured microbes. Weight loss of plastic has
been demonstrated both in studies where plastics were exposed
to soils, the marine water column and sediments (Syranidou
et al., 2017; Welden and Cowie, 2017) as well as in studies
focusing on the capability of a single strain to degrade specific
plastic polymers (Table 2). However, in environmental studies, it
remains unclear to which extent the observed plastic breakdown
was due to solely fungal activity. In the environment, the
observed breakdown may be facilitated by microorganisms other
than fungi and/or by microbial consortia, and/or by abiotic
factors, such as mechanical degradation. These factors remain
inseparable from potential fungal biodegradation. In contrast,
laboratory studies with single strains decrease the number of
biotic and abiotic factors, that may contribute to the plastic
degradation. Fungal isolates recovered from municipal solid
waste revealed that Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus fumigatus,
Lasiodiplodia crassispora, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium sp., and
Trichoderma harzianum were all able to cause a weight loss of
PE as well as PU (Raghavendra et al., 2016). A. niger showed
the highest biodegradation efficiency leading to a weight loss
of 2.9, 4.3, and 5.1% of LDPE sheets and 0.8, 1.5, and 2.2%
of PU sheets exposed for 30, 60 and 90 days, respectively.
Fusarium oxysporum as well as Aspergillus sp. have previously
been shown to cause weight loss of LDPE (Das and Kumar,
2014). Trichoderma viride and Aspergillus nomius, isolated from
landfill soil, caused weight loss of LDPE films of 5.1 and 6.6%,

biopolymers in the terrestrial realm, these marine polymers also
feature chemical similarities with some plastic types (presence of
aromatic compounds, presence of carbonyl groups). The ability
of marine fungi to regulate their metabolism and to adapt to
different environments and substrates indicates that the number
of marine fungi with the potential to degrade plastics could
be underestimated.

ANALYTICAL TOOLS FOR ASSESSING
THE POTENTIAL FOR FUNGI-MEDIATED
PLASTIC DEGRADATION
Relatively little is known about the potential for microbial
plastic biodegradation in the marine environment (Wayman
and Niemann, 2021). However, the chemical structures of most
plastic polymers render them rather durable, which makes it
challenging to evaluate the biodegradability of conventional
plastics and to identify the key organisms mediating this process.
As the majority of studies evaluating plastic breakdown have
been conducted in the terrestrial environment (Ru et al., 2020),
the methods reviewed below do not focus solely on the marine
systems (Table 3).

Gravimetric Measurements and Growth
of Biomass
To date, the most commonly applied technique to assess
plastic biodegradation is based on gravimetric measurement of

Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org

Zeghal et al.

Plastic Degradation by Marine Fungi

respectively, after 45 days (Munir et al., 2018). Cladosporium
tenuissimum caused 25.9 and 65.3% of weight loss of PE-PU
foams with and without flame retardants, respectively (ÁlvarezBarragán et al., 2016). The marine fungus Zalerion maritimum
exposed to PE microplastics caused mass loss of 56.7 ± 2.9% of
the plastic, corresponding to 43% of removal after 2 weeks of
exposure (Paço et al., 2017).
Although determining the weight loss of plastic is a
straightforward method, it requires a long monitoring time,
ranging from months to years to yield measurable gravimetric
changes, while short term studies often yield inconclusive
results (Lee et al., 1991). Gravimetric measurements require
post incubation treatments, i.e., the removal of the biofilm
from the incubated plastic. This can easily cause measurement
artifacts; e.g., the incomplete removal of biofilm or accidental
removal of a polymer respectively leads to an under or
overestimation of weight loss. Weight loss measurements
indicate that plastic polymers indeed disintegrate over time,
however, this type of measurement does not reveal whether
the polymer is broken down physiochemically (e.g., plastics
release lower molecular weight compounds as a result of
photooxidation; Wayman and Niemann, 2021) or if the plastic
polymer was hydrolyzed and metabolized by microbes. Some
plastics (e.g., polyvinyl chloride) contain high quantities of
additives which, if soluble, can be released, and thus bias
weight loss measurements. Also, biomass figures (i.e., cell
numbers, culture dry weight) are typically not reported for

culture-based studies, making these investigations quantitatively
non-repeatable, thus, severely limiting comparability. Hence,
gravimetric measurements are insufficient to identify plastic
degrading organisms and microbial kinetics, but should be
accompanied by other methods.
Determining microbial biomass growth on plastic as the sole
carbon source (e.g., monitoring cell numbers) has been used to
infer the biodegradability of a specific polymer. Together with
monitoring the weight loss of the polymer, some studies have
measured an increase in fungal biomass as an indicator for the
activity of fungi (Paço et al., 2017), and interpreted that the
increase in fungal biomass occurred at the expense of carbon
originating from the plastics.

Clearance Zone Formation
The growth of fungi at the expense of plastic can be monitored
visually with degradation assays based on plates coated with agar
and solubilized plastic. Inoculation at the surface and utilization
of the plastic leads to the formation of clearance zones, referred
to as ‘halos.’ Appearance of ‘halos’ on plates with plastics as the
sole carbon source is used as an indicator for plastic degradation.
The fungal species Cladosporium cladosporioides, Xepiculopsis
graminea, and Penicillium griseofulvum and Leptosphaeria sp.,
isolated from plastic debris from the lake Zurich, formed
clearance zones on PU. However, none of these strains
were able to degrade polyethylene (Brunner et al., 2018).

Plastic Degradation by Marine Fungi

have been successful for Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus
(Deepika and Madhuri, 2015).
Clearance zone tests allow for rapid visual observations.
However, the technique has the drawback that it requires
dissolving the polymer in an organic solvent that can be applied
to the petri dish at relatively cold temperatures to avoid agar
melting. Furthermore, remnants of the solvents (rather than the
plastic) may act as a carbon source for the fungi, leading to falsepositive results. In addition, bias associated with clearance zone
formation is relatively large, as clearance zones are not uniform
in size or shape. Finally, fungi with hyphae may grow through the
plastic, thus gain access to the agar below, which can also lead to
false-positive results. As agar also represents a carbon source, this
test alone does not prove microbial plastic degradation.

Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique
used to obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption, emission,
and photoconductivity of a material allowing to determine the
chemical identity of most polymers. Furthermore, the FTIR
spectrum enables detection and semi-quantification of changes of
the original polymer configuration, for example, the introduction
of carbonyl groups during polymer oxidation (Xu et al., 2019;
Almond et al., 2020). The degree of carbonylation can be
enumerated by determining the carbonyl index (calculated from
the ratio between the integrated band absorbance of the carbonyl
and that of the methylene peaks). Carbonyl indexes, as a measure
of degradation, has been applied for a variety of polymers,
such as PU (Filip, 1979; Álvarez-Barragán et al., 2016), PE
(Paço et al., 2017), PS (Tian et al., 2017), and PP (Sheik et al.,
2015). PE degradation has been evaluated by FTIR in co-cultures
of bacteria and fungi, Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus and A. niger,
isolated from soil (Esmaeili et al., 2013). For example, Penicillium
variabile CCF3219 strain decreased the carbonyl peaks of preoxidized 14C-βPS after 16 weeks of incubation and ozonation
pre-treatment enhanced subsequent biodegradation (Tian et al.,
2017). An additional advantage of FTIR is that it can be used
for small plastic particles (the diffraction limit in IR spectroscopy
is ∼10–20 µm).
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy is a straightforward
and reliable technique, however, it often yields non-quantitative
results that are difficult to compare between studies. Also,
the attachment of biofilm on the plastic surfaces affects the
plastics optical properties in the IR range because proteinic
and polysaccharide contents of the biomass will change the
polymer’s IR spectrum (Bonhomme et al., 2003). Samples must
hence be pretreated to remove biofilms, e.g., using hydrogen
peroxide (Löder and Gerdts, 2015) or sodium dodecyl sulfate
(Zhang et al., 2020). These chemicals have been described
as the least aggressive. Nevertheless, chemical treatments can
modify the molecular structure of plastic surfaces, which can
introduce biases.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to create a surface
image by directing a high-intensity electron beam at the surface
and scanning over this surface. SEM allows high magnification,
thus offers high resolution at the nanometer range. SEMbased observations are used to examine and evaluate the
colonization of plastic films or particles by microorganisms and
to simultaneously visualize cracks, pits and deformations on the
plastic surface (Zettler et al., 2013; Vaksmaa et al., 2021a), which
in return can indicate if the polymer is degraded. SEM has
been applied in several studies to investigate fungi on plastics,
for example, to visualize the growth of C. tenuissimum and
C. pseudocladosporioides hyphae within PE-PU foams (ÁlvarezBarragán et al., 2016). Furthermore, Paço et al. (2017) visualized
the attachment of Z. maritimum on PE. With SEM, also surface
roughness of single plastic fragments can be visualized. Floating
marine plastics often feature signs of abrasion, cracking and
ongoing fragmentation (Zettler et al., 2013; Vaksmaa et al.,
2021b). Also, plastics exposed to the marine environment
developed such signs during the incubation. For example,
Welden and Cowie (2017) exposed PE, PP and Nylon to
marine sediment for 12 months and found breaks and increased
fraying on nylon ropes, surface scratching and roughening
on PE filament rope, cracks, fissures and finer surface fibers
scaling off from PP.
Scanning electron microscopy is a rapid technique, and
allows to visualize surface attachment and morphological
microstructures. Observations by SEM without chemical fixation
can be achieved by applying FIB-SEM (Focused Ion Beam milling
combined with Scanning Electron Microscopy). However, SEM
does not allow phylogenetic identification of the microbes
(unless the strain-specific morphological characteristics allow
this) and the formation and attachment of biofilms is not
necessarily an indication for biodegradation. Furthermore,
though SEM is a valuable tool to visualize surface defects
(e.g., cracks) of the plastic, it does not allow to scale in
Z-direction (i.e., to measure the depth of cracks). Alternatively,
this may be achieved by atomic force microscopy (AFM).
For example, an increase in surface roughness and formation
of cracks and grooves on PE films were investigated with
AFM after exposure to two different Penicillium strains
(Ojha et al., 2017).

Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org

Assays With 13 C or 14 C Labeled
Polymers
Isotopically labeled plastics can be traced into biodegradation
products sensitively and quantitatively (Lanctôt et al., 2018;
Taipale et al., 2019). The first studies involving isotopically
labeled plastics were conducted with the radio isotope 14 C.
The fungus Fusarium redolens liberated 14 C-CO2 , originating
from pulverized 14 C-labeled HDPE (Albertsson, 1978, 1980;
Albertsson et al., 1978). 14 C labeled 14 C-CO2 formation was
also evaluated after photoirradiation of 14 C-αPS and 14 C-βPS,
exposed to garden soil and activated sludge, showing higher
14 C-CO formation in treatments with photo oxidized polymer.

The authors quantified degradation rates and showed that
complete degradation of the 14 C-αPS polymer in garden soil
would require 20 to 80 years and in activated sludge from 11
to 24 years (Guillet et al., 1974). 14 C labeled polystyrene was
also used to test PS degradation capabilities of 17 different
fungal species in a 14 days incubation experiment during

Plastic Degradation by Marine Fungi

which 0 to 0.24% of the 14 C-PS was degraded (Kaplan et al.,
1979). Because radioactivity can be measured and quantified
extremely sensitively, radio isotope probing allows determining
extremely low plastic degradation rates. Nevertheless, the use of
radio-chemicals entails the necessity for specialized laboratory
facilities and trained personnel, and the radio-labeled base
materials for synthesizing polymers are extremely expensive
or not available at all. This makes the use of radio isotopes
mostly impractical. However, using plastics labeled with stable
isotopes (e.g., containing a high degree of 13 C or 2 H) provides a
good alternative. Similar to radio isotope probing, stable isotope
probing (SIP) offers the advantages to allow tracing plastic
derived matter into degradation products (Sander et al., 2019;
Taipale et al., 2019), though the ubiquitous presence of 13 C
and 2 H in most types of matter makes SIP assays less sensitive
compared to approaches with radio isotopes. Nevertheless, no
study using 13 C or 2 H labeled conventional plastics (PE, PP, PET,
PS, PU, and nylon) for investigating interactions of marine fungi
and plastics has been published yet. On the other hand, Zumstein
et al. (2018) used 13 C-PBAT (Polybutylene adipate terephthalate)
to study its microbial degradation in soil.

degraders, yet this needs to be demonstrated in future studies.
However, in comparison to investigating bacterial communities,
taxonomic and physiological characterization of (marine) fungi
is not as straightforward and standardized methods are generally
lacking. Indeed, molecular studies on fungi still encounter classic
difficulties and biases related to molecular techniques such as
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) bias, library preparation bias,
sequencing bias, bioinformatics biases and unequal sequencing
depth. Perhaps the most hindering factors in molecular studies of
fungi are: (i) nucleic acid extraction method bias (ii) marker gene
bias when using 18S rRNA or ITS spacer and (iii) primer bias.
In addition, also (iv) culture-based methods are hindered by the
fact that identification based on morphological features (alone) is
difficult, growth conditions are hard to determine and fungi have
complex life cycles.
(i) Fungal genomic DNA extraction is less straightforward
in comparison to extracting DNA from bacteria. Fungal
cell walls are made of chitin making them more robust
than a peptidoglycan bacterial cell wall (Fredricks et al.,
2005; Shin, 2018). Breaking down fungal cells requires
further steps such as the addition of lysing agents (for
example, adapting the lysis buffer or adding enzymes such
as cutinases) and/or mechanical disruption (e.g., increasing
bead-beating steps or introducing freeze-thaw cycles) to
increase fungal DNA yields, while maintaining the integrity
of the DNA. Furthermore, different fungal strains may
require different extraction steps to be added, complicating
DNA extraction from the whole fungal community in
environmental samples.
(ii) Selection of a reliable marker gene (gene section) is
influenced not only by the number of targeted taxa,
but also the feasibility of down-stream analysis as this
depends on the availability of data stored in publicly
available databases. For prokaryotes, several and up to
date databases exist for 16S rRNA gene sequences (and
are publicly accessible), while far less information is
available for 18S rRNA sequences. One of the most
commonly used database is SILVA, but while the SILVA
ref 138.1 release (Quast et al., 2013) contains 2,052,220
16S rRNA gene sequences (1,983,022 bacterial and 69,198
archaeal sequences), it only contains172,520 18S rRNA
gene sequences, of which 30,386 were classified as fungi.
SILVA also, hosts a repository of 9329 representative 18S
rRNA gene sequences covering all of the fungal kingdom
and includes a manually curated alignment, and reference
phylogenetic tree (Yarza et al., 2017). An alternative
database for the identification of fungi is the ITS sequence
database UNITE, but the most recent release (Nilsson et al.,
2018) contains a similarly low number of 30,555 fungal
sequences. Reich and Labes (2017) reviewed the available
molecular ecology tools including their advantages and
drawbacks when applied to the community studies of
marine fungi. Even when the available number of 18S
rRNA gene sequences, ITS sequences and fungal genomes
has increased substantially, these numbers stand in stark
contrast to the estimated several million fungal species
(Nilsson et al., 2015). About 50% of the described fungal

Other Methods
Additional methods to evaluate plastic degradation include
the following techniques: (i) Respiratory measurements of O2
consumption or CO2 production, which can provide quantitative
information of degradation, but cannot discriminate between
different respiration pathways. (ii) Tensile resistance alterations
of plastic can be used as a measure of the strength/integrity of the
plastics, which will decrease as a function of degradation (yet, also
physiochemically induced degradation reduces tensile strength).
(iii) Thermo Gravimetrical Analysis (TGA) characterizes the
thermal stability of a polymer, which can potentially indicate
its degradation (similar to tensile strength). (iv) Differential
scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis assesses the thermal
properties of synthetic polymers, such as glass transition
Temperature (Tg ).
Lower Tg temperatures are often related to a decrease in
the stability, indicating degradation (Lucas et al., 2008). (v)
High-Temperature Gel Permeation Chromatography (HT-GPC)
provides information on the molecular weight (Mn%) and
molecular weight distribution of the polymer. A decrease in Mn%
is evidence of chain cleavage that can be related to microbial
degradation. Nevertheless, just as alterations of tensile resistance,
glass transition Temperature, thermal stability and the molecular
weight will also change in response to physicochemical processes
Finally, none of the other methods described in this section is able
to unambiguously prove the occurrence of complete microbial
biodegradation, from initial depolymerization to mineralization
and biomass assimilation.

LIMITATIONS OF STUDYING FUNGAL
COMMUNITIES
In comparison to bacteria, fungi in the marine realm are
understudied and often overlooked. It seems likely that fungi
are relevant as saprotrophs in general and may act as plastic

Plastic Degradation by Marine Fungi

(iv) Culture-based methods are time-consuming and the
culture media will have a selective effect on fungal
growth. There is no specific medium for marine fungi
available to date, but only adaptions of media selective
for terrestrial fungi. The morphological diversity associated
with different developmental stages of the same species,
complicates the identification of fungal isolates (Xu,
2016). Nevertheless, only culturing of strains isolated from
environmental samples enables in-depth investigation of
their physiological and metabolic capabilities. Overy et al.
(2019) published a toolkit of best practices for the
culturing and isolation of marine fungi. We thus argue
that combining molecular and isolation/culturing effort
is the best way to evaluate interactions between fungal
communities and plastics in marine environments.

species still lack any DNA sequence information in public
databases (Xu, 2016). In order to fill the taxonomic markerrelated gaps in public databases, it has been suggested to use
third-generation sequencing and apply ribosomal tandem
repeat sequencing to cover all ribosomal markers for fungi
(Wurzbacher et al., 2019).
(iii) Different nuclear ribosomal DNA marker genes are
used for the identification of fungal species. However,
environmental studies on fungal communities, apply most
commonly the ITS and the 18S rRNA marker gene. The
ITS region has been proposed as a universal barcode for
fungal DNA as it may allow for a better resolution of
fungal taxonomy than the 18S rRNA gene overall (Schoch
et al., 2012). ITS barcoded sequencing has been successfully
applied for both unicellular as well as for filamentous fungi
(Vu et al., 2016, 2019). Many ITS targeting primers have
been developed in recent years (Martin and Rygiewicz,
2005; Manter and Vivanco, 2007; Toju et al., 2012).
However, choosing adequate thresholds for taxonomic
assignments in ITS processing pipelines is delicate as the
average intraspecific ITS variability is fluctuating (Smith
et al., 2007; Simon and Weiß, 2008). For example, 0.2%
for A. fumigatus, 3.1% for F. solani and up to 24.2% for
the Ascomycota Xylaria hypoxylon (Nilsson et al., 2008).
Vu et al. (2016, 2019) suggested that a threshold of 98.41%
should be applied for ITS to distinguish between yeast
species and a threshold of 99.6% should be applied to
discriminate between filamentous fungi. Moreover, within
an individual, ITS polymorphism (Alper et al., 2011) and
ITS hybrid forms (Sriswasdi et al., 2019) were reported.
Consequently, even when using fungal specific primers
(ITS), intraspecific variability might not lead to species
identification. Use of ITS shows even more limitations
when dealing with marine fungi. Indeed, the ITS marker
has a higher divergence rate compared to the 18S rRNA
marker gene in marine fungal communities where early
diverging fungi are abundant, and thus results into low
classification success rates for ITS (Nilsson et al., 2019). For
example, De Tender et al. (2017) could not assign 28 to 99%
of the fungal reads acquired in their study when using ITS.
To overcome this issue, it has been suggested to combine
multiple marker genes for the molecular identification
of the members of marine fungal communities. Banos
et al. (2018) suggested to apply a fungi-specific 18S rRNA
primers according to different environments, conditions or
goals. This raises a new issue when using fungal specific
ITS/18S primers, as different sets may overestimate some
taxa and, in some cases, not target any fungus at all. By
using a long read sequencing approach multiple marker
genes can be retrieved at the same time, which allows for
better taxonomic resolution (Heeger et al., 2018). Studies
focusing on fungi colonizing plastic debris are scarce and
the use of different marker genes and short read sequencing
technology (Table 1) makes comparison between different
datasets difficult. Unfortunately, no credible hypotheses on
the presence or absence of a core fungal community living
on plastic can be formulated yet.

CONCLUSION-OUTLOOK
This mini-review summarizes the current knowledge on marine
fungi – PMD interactions; i.e., the ability of fungi to colonize
plastics and specific strains known to degrade plastics as well
as the methodological advances and difficulties in studying
fungi – PMD interactions. Investigating the interaction of marine
fungi and PMD is an emerging and exciting field of research
when considering the high potential for plastic degradation
of several fungal strains. Yet, for a well-constrained appraisal
of marine fungi and their role as plastic degraders, several
knowledge gaps still need to be filled. Firstly, a more general and
fundamental understanding of fungi in the marine environment
needs to be achieved by addressing fungal prevalence and
diversity in the ocean. By using new molecular markers, the
available sequence databases could be expanded for future
classification of fungi detected on plastic polymers and to classify
currently unclassified fungi. To address the biodegradation
potential of fungi, comparable detection methods should be
used to enable comparison between different strains, polymers
and studies. Also, we suggest applying several complementary
techniques for assessing biodegradation, particularly if the used
techniques might cause false positives. Once fungal species
degrading plastic in the marine environment are identified, future
research should address the enzymatic potential of these fungi,
which might then serve biotechnological applications for plastic
waste bioremediation.
