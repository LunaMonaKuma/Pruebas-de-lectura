Abstract
This study investigated the potential of wastepaper hydrolysate as a sustainable and low-cost carbon source for single-cell oil and protein production, attending to the growing need for alternative feedstocks and waste management strategies. Wastepaper, characterized by its high carbohydrate content, was subjected to enzymatic and chemo-enzymatic treatments for carbohydrate release. The chemo-enzymatic treatment performed better, yielding 65.3 g L-1 of fermentable sugars. Sixty-two yeast strains were screened for single-cell oil accumulation, identifying Rhodotorula mucilaginosa M1K4 as the most advantageous oleaginous yeast. M1K4 lipid and protein production was optimized in liquid culture, and its fatty acid profile was analyzed, showing a high content of industrially valuable fatty acids, particularly palmitic (28%) and oleic (51%). Batch-culture of M1K4 in a 3 L reactor demonstrated the strain's ability to utilize wastepaper hydrolysate as a carbon source, with dry cell weight, total lipid and protein production of 17.5 g L-1, 4.5 g L-1, and 2.1 g L-1, respectively. Wastepaper as a substrate provides a sustainable solution for waste management and bioproduction. This research highlights the potential of R. mucilaginosa for lipid and protein production from wastepaper hydrolysate.

Introduction
As the global population continues to grow, the demand for food will inevitably increase. 
However, agriculture, the primary worldwide source of food production, faces several obstacles, such as the impact of climate change and the declining quality and scarcity of water and land resources (Bhattacharya, 2019; Mukherjee et al., 2021). Furthermore, it is increasingly common for consumers to demand healthier foods, production processes with a lower environmental impact, and alternatives that attend the food waste and animal welfare (FAO, 2022). These factors represent a new challenge in the pursuit of alternative sources of food and ingredients that are healthier, sustainable, affordable, and abundant. 

Lipids and proteins are vital components of the human diet. They are mainly ingested as animal and plant-based foodstuffs; however, there is a growing trend toward innovative sources, such as insects and yeasts. In particular, some factors make yeasts promising candidates for producing single-cell oil (SCO) and single-cell protein (SCP). For example, their production depends less on land and water availability and external factors like weather and pest infestations. Moreover, they have high acceptability due to their use in traditional fermentations (Najafpour, 2007; Ghazani and Marangoni, 2022; Mhlongo et al., 2021).

Non-Saccharomyces yeast have advantages for SCOs and SCPs production, i.e., metabolic versatility for the utilization of diverse carbon sources and simple cultivation requirements (Ratledge and Cohen, 2008), stress tolerance (e.g., pH, temperature, and oxygen) (Buzzini et al., 2012), ease of downstream processing (Papanikolaou and Aggelis, 2011), and faster growth rates (Sitepu et al., 2014). In addition, they are generally safe for food and feed applications, resistant to toxins (e.g., furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural, and acetic acid), and can produce heterologous proteins without hyper-glycosylation processes (Groenewald et al., 2014).

SCOs are intracellular storage lipids mainly represented as triacylglycerols containing unbranched chains of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with 4 to 28 carbons (Ratledge and Wynn, 2002; Patel et al., 2021). SCOs are primarily obtained by oleaginous organisms, which can accumulate more than 20% of their dry weight as lipids. Lipid accumulation in oleaginous organisms occurs when their metabolism is subjected to nitrogen-limited conditions with a high carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio (Lorenz et al., 2017; Gedela et al., 2023). 
Moreover, microorganisms also produce SCPs, with their quantity and quality depending on the species utilized and the culture conditions. In particular, SCP content in yeasts varies between 30-50% (w w-1) (Salazar-López et al., 2022), which can be higher than traditional food sources such as soy (38.6%), fish (16.3.8%), meat (23.9%), and whole milk (7.81%) (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2023).

Rhodotorula mucilaginosa is a non-conventional yeast that has gained relevance in recent years due to its metabolic capacity to produce diverse metabolites in the fuel, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, R. mucilaginosa can utilize diverse carbon sources, including complex sugars, and grow in harsh conditions such as high salinity, low pH, and high concentration of heavy metals (Torres-Alvarez et al., 2022). Therefore, it is a promising option for its growth in residue-based media to reduce the production cost of metabolites and the environmental impact of residues.

The paper industry generates significant amounts of residues since, despite a change to digitalization, 398.5 million tons of paper were consumed worldwide in 2016 (Martin and Haggith, 2018). Office paper is one of the most widely produced and stands out for its potential as a biotechnology substrate. Its major components, 87% cellulose and 8% hemicelluloses in demineralized samples, can be hydrolyzed by cellulases, ß-glucosidases, and hemicellulases to yield fermentable sugar-rich mixtures (Ioelovich, 2014). Furthermore, its low lignin content (<1%) enhances the enzymes accessibility during hydrolysis, compared to other types of paper and lignocellulosic residues, which require high-temperature chemical pretreatments (Ioelovich, 2014; Al-Azkawi et al., 2019).

This work aimed to study the capability of yeasts to co-produce SCOs and SCPs using wastepaper hydrolysate as a culture medium. Sixty-two strains were evaluated and classified according to their lipid accumulation capability. An R. mucilaginosa strain was selected to optimize and co-produce SCOs and SCPs in a 3 L bioreactor.

Wastepaper residues
Wastepaper was donated by a local publisher. The chemical analysis of the wastepaper was carried out according to Casas-Godoy et al. (2022).

Wastepaper hydrolysis 
Paper hydrolysis was evaluated by enzymatic (E) and chemical-enzymatic (CE) treatments. In E treatment, a preparation of 10% (w v-1) wastepaper was adjusted to pH 5.5 ± 0.3, and the enzyme blend Cellic(r) CTec2 was added at a final concentration of 2% (v v-1). Then, the mixture was incubated for 20 h at 50°C and 220 rpm. The residual paper solids were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 8 min, and the supernatant was filtrated with a 0. 22 µm pore size. For CE hydrolysis, 10% (w v-1) wastepaper was prepared in 1% (v v-1) H2SO4, pH adjusted to 1 and autoclaved for 15 min at 121°C. After pretreatment, the mixture pH was adjusted to pH 5.5 ± 0.3 and treated with Cellic(r) CTec2, as mentioned above. The following methodology was used to quantify the hydrolysates' total sugars, reducing sugars, lipids, and free amino nitrogen content.

Analytical methods 
Carbohydrates
Total sugars (TS) were quantified using the phenol sulfuric acid method, according to (DuBois et al., 1956). First, 100 µL of the sample and 100 µL of a phenol solution (5% w v-1) were mixed. Then 500 µL of concentrated sulfuric acid were added. When the mixture reached room temperature, 200 µL were added to a microplate and measured at 490 nm. A standard glucose curve (0-0.2 g L-1) was used as a reference. 
Reducing sugars (RS) were measured based on Miller (1959) using the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) methodology. First, 100 µL of sample and 100 µL of DNS reagent were added and heated for 5 min at 100°C. Next, the microtube was cooled for 5 min in ice, and 300 µL of distilled water were added. Finally, 200 µL of the mixture were added to a microplate and measured at 540 nm. A standard glucose solution (0-2.0 g L-1) was also used as a reference. 

Free amino nitrogen
Free amino nitrogen (FAN) content was measured using the ninhydrin method (Lie, 1973). First, 150 µL of color reactive (4.97% (w v-1) Na2HPO4·H2O, 6% (w v-1) KH2PO4, 0.5% (w v-1) ninhydrin, 0.3 % (w v-1) fructose) were mixed with 10 µL of sample and heated at 100°C for 16 min. Next, the microtube was cooled in ice, and 240 µL of the dilution reagent (0.2% w v-1 KIO3, 61.6% v v-1 distilled water, and 38.4% v v-1 ethanol) were added. Finally, 150 µL of the mixture were measured at 570 nm. A standard glycine solution (0-1.0 g L-1) was used as a reference. 

Protein quantification 
The yeasts were lysed using an adapted method from Rachamontree et al. (2015). Yeast biomass was recovered from 100 µl of culture by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Cell pellets were washed three times with distilled water and resuspended in 100 µL of lysis buffer (0.5% v v-1 of Triton X-100, 0.372 g L-1 of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 0.0345 g L-1 of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysis suspension was incubated at 400 rpm and 30°C for 20 min and sonicated for 10 min. The protein content was measured using the Lowry protein assay, according to Waterborg (2009).

Lipids extraction and quantification
A method adapted from Visnovitz et al. (2019) was utilized. For lipid extraction, 2 to 5 mL of culture were centrifugated at 4,000 rpm for 7 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL of distilled water. The biomass was washed twice, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of HCl 4M. The sample was incubated at 60°C and 220 rpm for 4 h. Then, 6 mL of a 2:1 (v:v) chloroform:methanol solution were added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h at 180 rpm. The mixture was centrifugated at 4,000 rpm for 8 min, and the biomass and aqueous phase were discarded. The lipid content in the organic phase was determined by the colorimetric sulfo-phospho-vanillin (SPV) method. For this, 10-50 µL of the organic phase were added to a microtube, and the solvent was eliminated by rotatory evaporation with a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant). Then, 50 µL of distilled water and 200 µL of H2SO4 were added. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 100°C and cooled on ice for 5 min. Next, 500 µL of vanillin at 1.2 g L-1 in phosphoric acid (17.4% v v-1) were added. The sample was incubated for 15 min at 37°C, and its absorbance was analyzed in microplates at 530 nm. Olive oil (Carbonell (r)) (0-150 µg), processed as the samples, was used as a reference. The lipid content was expressed as a percentage of dry cell weight (% DCW). 

Fatty acid profile
The lipid fraction was esterified to obtain fatty acid methyl esters. First, 2.5 mL of the lipid extraction were concentrated in a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant) and resuspended in 5 mL of the methylation solution (500 mg of heptadecanoic acid in 2.5 mL H2SO4 and 97.5 mL CH3OH). Next, the solution was heated at 100°C for 2 h, and 550 µL of hexane and 1500 µL of distilled water were added. The sample was mixed vigorously, centrifugated at 8,000 g for 4 min, and then the organic phase was recovered. Samples were analyzed using a GC device model 6890 (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a Zebron ZB-FAME column (30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.20 µm thickness (Varian Inc., USA) connected to a flame ionization detector (FID) at 260°C. The carrier gas was He with a 1.2 mL min-1 constant flow. The oven program was 100°C for 2 min, increased to 140°C at 10°C min-1, then to 190°C at 3°C min-1, and heat to 260°C at 30°C min-1, and finally held for 2 min. The identification of the methyl esters was carried out using pure standards.

Agar screening for lipid production 
Based on Niehus et al. (2018), the lipid production of 62 yeast strains was evaluated in agar utilizing a nitrogen-limited culture medium with a high carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N 40). The culture medium was prepared by mixing 523.3 mL of sterile hydrolysate e (62.5 g L-1 of RS) (sterilized with a 0.22 µm pore size Stericup(r) system) with 0.73 g peptone, 0.22 g yeast extract, 7.0 g KH2PO4, 1.25 g Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.5 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.4 NH4Cl, 6 g agar and 476.6 mL of distilled water. The pH was adjusted to 5.5 ± 0.2. Sterile Rhodamine B dissolved in ethanol was added to the media at a final 5 mg mL-1 concentration. Inoculated plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h and examined with white light and a UV lamp at 365 nm (Analytik Jena). Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ethanol Red(r)) and a Yarrowia lipolytica (ylXYL+obese) strain (Niehus et al., 2018b) were used as negative and positive controls for lipid production, respectively. 

Liquid screening for lipid and protein production 
The strains selected during the agar screening (17 yeasts) were evaluated for lipids and protein production in a liquid medium. The medium had the same composition as the nitrogen-limiting medium previously described (C/N: 40), except that agar and Rhodamine B were not added. The cultures were carried out by duplicate in 250 mL baffled Erlenmeyer flasks at 30°C and 220 rpm with an initial volume of 60 mL. The inoculum corresponded to 10% (v v-1) of the initial volume. Dry cell weight biomass (DCW), RS, FAN, protein, and lipid content were monitored for 72 h.

Box Behnken analysis for the optimization of culture parameters
The lipid and protein production of the R. mucilaginosa M1K4 strain was improved with a Box-Behnken design varying agitation and C/N content (Table 2). Experimental design and analyses were performed with the software STATGRAPHICS Centurion XVI v.16.1.00 with a confidence level of 85%. A coefficient of regression value over 0.9 was selected as the criteria for acceptance of the predicted model. The composition of the nitrogen source in all experiments was fixed to 0.35 g L-1 NH4Cl, 0.7 g L-1 yeast extract, and 0.35 g L-1 peptone. The C/N ratio was adjusted by varying the volume of hydrolysate added (65 g L-1 RS). All experiments were carried out by duplicate, and the final data were reported as mean values. The predicted optimized conditions were confirmed to validate model accuracy.

Lipid and protein production in bioreactor
To evaluate lipid and protein production from wastepaper hydrolysates, batch bioreactor cultures were performed by duplicate in 3 L glass bioreactors using a 2 vvm aeration, 1000 rpm agitation, and an initial pH of 5.5. The working volume was 2 L with an inoculum of 10% (v v-1). The C/N ratio was adjusted to 80, as indicated by the Box-Behnken design as the optimal value for lipid production. The medium contained 65 g L-1 of RS, 0.35 g L-1 NH4Cl, 0.7 g L-1 yeast extract, 0.35 g L-1 peptone, 7.0 g L-1 KH2PO4, 1.25 g L-1 Na2HPO4·7H2O, and 1.5 g L-1 MgSO4·7H2O.

Identification of the selected oleaginous yeast strain
R. mucilaginosa M1K4 was identified by amplifying the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region using universal primers ITS1 (5'-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3') and ITS4 (5'-CCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3'). Genomic DNA was extracted from a 5 ml overnight culture at 30°C in rich media YPD (1% w w-1 yeast extract, 2% w w-1 peptone, and 2% w w-1 dextrose). 1 ml of the overnight culture was pelleted in a microcentrifuge, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of 0.1N TE buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA). 450 ml of TENS buffer were added, and the mixture was incubated in ice for 5 min. Then, the sample was mixed with 225 ml of sodium acetate 3M, incubated in ice for 5 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at room temperature at 12,000 rpm. The aqueous layer was transferred to a tube containing 700 ml of cold absolute ethanol and incubated in ice for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm, and the DNA pellet was washed with 700 ml of cold ethanol (70%). After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the DNA pellet was dried and resuspended in 50 ml of 0.1N TE buffer. DNA was visualized in an agarose gel (1%) and quantified (NanoDrop spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The PCR reaction mixture (25 µL) contained 250 ng of template DNA from the yeast genome, 5ml PCR buffer, 0.2 µM, 0.3 mM dNTP, and 1.25 U of GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). PCR was performed in a SimpliAmp(tm) thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems(tm), Waltham, MA, USA), using the following parameters: initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55.5°C for 1.3 min and extension at 72°C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR product was purified and sequenced by Psomagen Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). Sequences were assembled and analyzed using CLC Genomics workbench 22. Similarity among sequences of the fungal ITS was performed using BLASTn (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). The consensus sequence was deposited in the GenBank database under accession number OQ968333.

Results and discussion
Wastepaper characterization and hydrolyzate preparation
The wastepaper was characterized (Table 3), indicating a composition rich in total carbohydrates (76% w w-1) with minimal protein (0.75% w w-1) and fat content (0.12% w w-1). This high carbohydrate, low fat, and protein content are due to its wood-based origin and papermaking processes, which favor cellulose and hemicellulose concentration while reducing proteins and fats in the final product.

Two hydrolysis methods were employed to release fermentable sugars from wastepaper: E and CE treatments. The E treatment yielded moderate sugar levels (15.98 g L-1 TS and 15.36 g L-1 RS), while the CE treatment significantly increased sugar release (70.27 g L-1 TS and 65.36 g L-1 RS). The marked difference in sugar yield between the two methods indicates that chemical pretreatment effectively breaks complex carbohydrate structures, thus facilitating enzymatic hydrolysis and enhancing sugar release. 
In their studies, Nair, Al-bahry, and Sivakumar (2020) and Sadasivan et al. (2020) carried out enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase and ß-glucosidase on office paper at an initial concentration of 30 g L-1 and 50 g L-1, respectively. Despite their successful 89% and 70% conversion yields after 92 hours, our investigation, using an initial paper concentration of 100 g L-1, yielded a slightly lower conversion rate (65%) but demonstrated a superior final concentration of fermentable sugars. As highlighted in the study by Ioelovich (2014), the discrepancy in conversion yields can be attributed to the mass transfer limitations caused by the initial paper load, which tends to enable higher conversion rates when the initial paper concentration is lower.
It is worth noting that while Ioelovich (2014) recommended the prior removal of minerals from waste office paper due to their detrimental effect on enzymatic digestibility, our study found that Cellic(r) Ctec2 was able to achieve satisfactory conversion yields while requiring short reaction times, even with mineral-containing paper. This result suggests Cellic(r) Ctec2 ability to maintain its activity under such challenging conditions.
High C/N ratios were obtained for both E and CE hydrolysates, 112.53 and 528.16, respectively. These elevated C/N ratios imply a potential advantage in lipid production since they can be easily supplemented with nitrogen and adjusted to desired ratios between 20 and 80, which are typically favorable for lipid accumulation in oleaginous yeasts (Papanikolaou and Aggelis, 2011).

Agar screening for lipid production 
Sixty-two yeast strains were evaluated for their ability to accumulate microbial lipids in solid-state cultures using paper hydrolysate as a carbon source with a C/N ratio 40 (Figure 1). The goal was to identify the lipid-producing yeast capable of using wastepaper hydrolysate as a carbon source. Colonies that changed from white to intense pink were considered oleaginous strains under white light. In the case of fluorescent light, blue indicated no lipid accumulation, while orange/pink coloration was observed for lipid accumulation. Strains without color variation were classified as non-oleaginous. Based on growth and the coloration presented, five levels of accumulation were established: 1) no-growth, 2) non-accumulation, 3) low accumulation, 4) medium accumulation, and 5) high accumulation (Figure 1). 


Figure 2 contains the results of the agar screening. Twenty strains demonstrated high lipid accumulation. These corresponded to Yarrowia lipolytica (15 strains), Hanseniaspora uvarum (3 strains), Kodamaea ohmeri (1 strain), and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (1 strain). Nine strains showed medium lipid accumulation, including Y. lipolytica (2 strains), Debaryomyces hansenii (1 strain), Candida guillermondii (1 strain), Candida utilis (1 strain), Kluyveromyces marxianus (3 strains), and K. ohmeri (1 strain). Lastly, thirty-three strains exhibited low or no lipid accumulation, which were Candida sp. (8 strains), D. hansenii (20 strains), R. mucilaginosa (3 strains), Y. lipolytica (1 strain), and K. marxianus (1 strain).

The observed variability in lipid accumulation among strains of the same genus may be attributed to the inherent genetic diversity and metabolic differences between species and strains (Sitepu et al., 2014). For example, Y. lipolytica is a well-known oleaginous yeast capable of accumulating high levels of lipids (Beopoulos et al., 2009). However, one strain of Y. lipolytica (strain 35) exhibited low lipid accumulation, possibly due to strain-specific differences in metabolic pathways or regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, external factors such as culture conditions and nutrient availability may also influence lipid production (Ratledge, 2004). The high lipid accumulation observed in Y. lipolytica, R. mucilaginosa, and K. ohmeri is consistent with previous studies that reported these species as lipid producers (Papanikolaou and Aggelis, 2011; Braga et al., 2016; Ayadi et al., 2018). On the other hand, strains with low lipid accumulation, such as D. hansenii, have been reported to possess lower lipid production capabilities or require specific conditions for optimal lipid accumulation (Merdinger and Shair, 1962; Merdinger, SHAIR and Devine, 1965).

Liquid screening for lipid and protein production 
For liquid screening, seventeen strains with high or medium lipid accumulation and high biomass production in agar were chosen and evaluated for lipid and protein production in liquid culture. The yeasts were cultivated at 30°C for 72 h in a nitrogen-limited medium (C/N 40) with wastepaper hydrolyzate as a carbon source.

Among the strains evaluated, strain 14 (R. mucilaginosa M1K4) stands out with the highest lipid production (4.58 g L-1) and a high lipid content (30% w w-1). In the literature, R. mucilaginosa has been reported as a promising oleaginous yeast with high lipid accumulation potential (Li et al., 2022). This strain's performance supports the existing knowledge of its potential for lipid production.
Another notable specie was Y. lipolytica, with 11 strains showing varying lipid content and production. Y. lipolytica is a well-known oleaginous yeast extensively studied for lipid accumulation capabilities (Papanikolaou and Aggelis, 2011). Strain 39 has the highest lipid content (42% w w-1) among Y. lipolytica strains, followed by strain 40 (26.9% w w-1). Previous studies have reported that Y. lipolytica can accumulate lipids to levels exceeding 50% of dry cell weight (Beopoulos et al., 2009).
Both K. marxianus strains show different lipid and protein production profiles. Strain 34 has a low lipid content (5.0%) but high protein production (1.92 g L-1), while strain 19 has a higher lipid content (8.6%) and lower protein production (1.18 g L-1). In addition, K. marxianus has been reported to accumulate lipids up to 10% of its cell dry weight (Cernak, Estrela, and Poddar, 2018). Its ability to produce high amounts of proteins has also been documented (Sarkar et al., 2013).
Among the strains tested, H. uvarum strain 47 had the highest lipid content (43.4% w w-1) but low lipid (0.35 g L-1) and protein production (0.20 g L-1) due to deficient cell growth. Limited information is available on the lipid accumulation potential of H. uvarum, making this observation noteworthy and requiring further investigation.
The data shows that the lipid content and production vary significantly among different strains and even within the same species. This variation can be attributed to genetic differences within the species, leading to variances in metabolic pathways and their efficiency in utilizing the carbon source for lipid accumulation. Further studies on the genetic and metabolic factors contributing to these strains' lipid and protein accumulation variations could help optimize their potential biotechnological applications for animal feed and human consumption.

Optimization of lipid and protein co-production of R. mucilaginosa
Figure 3 shows that the intracellular lipid percentage after 72 hours increased as the C/N ratio changed from 20 to 80, indicating that higher ratios promote lipid accumulation within the cells (Machado et al., 2022). However, it is noteworthy that with C/N values exceeding 50, the intracellular lipid percentage remained stable after reaching the 24-hour mark. Contrarily, C/N values below 50 peaked at 24 hours, followed by a decrease in lipid percentage as the reaction progressed. This decline could be associated with the total exhaustion of the nitrogen source, forcing the cells to consume their lipids after 24 hours of fermentation.
Furthermore, even though lipid content remained constant, there was a significant increase in lipid production over time when employing C/N values above 50, reaching its peak at 72 hours. This increase was directly proportional to biomass growth, emphasizing the crucial role of biomass quantity on total lipid production (Figure 5). Such observations accentuate the importance of evaluating alternate approaches, like Fed-batch with R. mucilaginosa M1K4, to boost biomass production, followed by a lipid accumulation stage.

The intracellular protein content was lower with higher C/N ratios (Figure 4). This observation can be attributed to the rapid depletion of the nitrogen source when the C/N ratio is high. As the nitrogen source becomes limited, the microorganisms prioritize lipid synthesis over protein synthesis due to excess carbon availability. Consequently, a higher C/N ratio decreases intracellular protein content while promoting lipid accumulation. On the other hand, lower C/N ratios provide a more balanced nutrient environment, allowing higher intracellular protein content. These results highlight the importance of optimizing the C/N ratio to achieve the desired balance between lipid and protein production. The total protein production remained the same across different C/N ratios. However, the production increased over time, reaching its maximum at 72 hours due to biomass growth (Figure 5). 


The evaluated agitation speeds did not show a statistically significant effect on the intracellular production of lipids and proteins or the total production (data not shown). This suggests that agitation speed is not a critical factor influencing lipid and protein production under the tested conditions.

Reactor batch-culture of R. mucilaginosa M1K4
Batch cultures in 3 L reactors were conducted to determine lipid and protein production of R. mucilaginosa M1K4 at 30°C and utilizing paper hydrolysate as a carbon source with a C/N ratio of 80 and 1000 rpm (Figure 6). Low biomass production was observed at 500 and 800 rpm (data not shown). The dry cell weight experienced a rapid increase within the initial 10 hours (3.8 ± 0.03 g L-1), subsequently entering the stationary phase, which agrees with the depletion of free amino nitrogen at the 10-hour mark. This relationship is consistent with existing knowledge that nitrogen is a critical nutrient for yeast growth, as seen with many other yeast strains.
Regarding the lipid production behavior, the content of lipids rapidly increased during the initial hours, reaching a maximum of 65 % (w w-1), with 6.2  g L-1 of biomass, at the 15-hour mark, and subsequently started to decline. The decline in lipid content, which coincided with the initiation of the stationary phase and the decrease in nitrogen availability, further emphasizes the role of nitrogen in the metabolic shift toward lipid accumulation. The peak lipid production of 4.5 g L-1 achieved in this study also supports the potential of R. mucilaginosa M1K4 as a promising lipid producer. Comparing our study with others, Ayadi et al. (2019) employed hydrolyzed wheat bran as a substrate with a C/N ratio of 100, achieving a maximum lipid production of 4.5 g L-1, identical to our study under fed-batch fermentation with an R. mucilaginosa strain. A similar outcome was observed by Chang et al. (2013) when the oil-producing yeast strain, Cryptococcus sp. SM5S05 was grown on corncob acid hydrolysate using a fed-batch fermentation method, which resulted in a final lipid production rate of 4.5 g L-1. 
In contrast, Machado et al. (2022) reported a higher lipid content and production of 48.14% and 7.94 g L-1, respectively, with an R. mucilaginosa strain and a C/N ratio of 71 using a mixture of molasses and cassava wastewater. However, this was achieved after an extended cultivation period of 168 hours and a higher input of carbon source (54 g L-1 of molasses and 41.5 g L-1 of cassava) compared to our 65 g L-1 of reducing sugars. Despite their higher lipid yield, the longer cultivation time and more significant carbon source requirement suggest that our strain and conditions could favor a more efficient lipid production, particularly within the shorter 72-hour timeframe. However, direct comparisons should be made cautiously due to different strains and conditions.
As for protein content, this began at 29.4% and gradually decreased during the cultivation process, stabilizing around 11-12% at the stationary phase. This behavior results from nitrogen depletion causing the cells to prioritize essential protein synthesis over non-essential ones. The peak protein production was 2.1 g L-1, which is reasonable compared to other non-Saccharomyces yeast species.
The consumption of reducing sugars also played a crucial role in the observed lipid and protein content trends. Reducing sugars were rapidly consumed during the early hours of the cultivation, providing energy and carbon for biomass growth, lipid synthesis, and protein production. As the sugar consumption rate slowed during the stationary phase, the cells likely redirected their metabolic resources towards maintenance and survival, resulting in a decline in lipid content and stabilization of protein content.
  

Fatty acid profile
The fatty acid profile of R. mucilaginosa M1K4 was determined during the reactor fermentation (Figure 7). The percentage of oleic acid (C18:1), the most abundant fatty acid, remained relatively stable throughout the experiment, ranging from 48.34% to 53.43%. These values suggest that oleic acid is a significant component of M1K4 lipids under these conditions. There was a substantial increase in linoleic acid (C18:2) content up to 16.48% as the incubation time progressed. Other fatty acids, such as palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0), decreased their percentages over time. 
The observed results can be explained by metabolic principles related to fatty acid synthesis in microorganisms. The stable percentage of oleic acid (C18:1) throughout the fermentation suggests that R. mucilaginosa M1K4 has a consistent ability to synthesize and maintain oleic acid levels, potentially regulated by enzymes such as desaturases (Cerone and Smith, 2022). The progressive increase in linoleic acid (C18:2) content indicates an upregulation of the enzymes involved in its synthesis, suggesting adaptation to meet the organism's fatty acid requirements. Furthermore, the decrease in palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) percentages over time suggests a potential shift in metabolic pathways or utilization of these fatty acids as substrates for other biosynthetic processes, such as desaturation of the fatty acids. 


The primary fatty acids obtained have a range of potential applications across several industries. Oleic acid can be used in the food industry as a healthier alternative to saturated fats and in producing oleochemicals, lubricants, surfactants, and detergents (Figueiredo et al., 2017). It is also a component in cosmetics and personal care products. Palmitic acid is commonly employed in producing soaps, cosmetics, and detergents. In addition, it can be a precursor for fatty acid esters, which serve as lubricants and emollients in various industries. Lastly, linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid with health-promoting properties and is utilized in the food industry as a dietary supplement and ingredient in margarine and other food products (Tvrzicka et al., 2011). 

Table 6 shows the fatty acid profile of some R. mucilaginosa strains evaluated in different studies, including this work. The similarities and differences in these fatty acid profiles can be attributed to factors such as carbon and nitrogen sources, incubation time, culture conditions, and strain-specific enzymatic activities. The percentages obtained in this work vary across the studies, with some fatty acids like myristic and palmitoleic only appearing in certain studies. Further research could investigate the impact of these variables on fatty acid composition and optimize culture conditions for producing specific fatty acids with industrial applications.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates the potential of using wastepaper as a carbon source for microbial lipid and protein production. Hydrolysis methods (E and CE) were employed to release fermentable sugars, with the CE treatment being the most effective. Sixty-two yeast strains were screened for lipid accumulation using paper hydrolysate, identifying R. mucilaginosa M1K4 as a promising candidate. From the 17 strains evaluated in liquid screening, M1K4 had the highest lipid production (4.5 g L-1) and significant protein production potential (2.1 g L-1) under nitrogen-limiting conditions. The C/N ratio greatly influenced lipid and protein production, with higher C/N ratios promoting lipid accumulation and lower ratios favoring protein synthesis. The study also highlighted the ability of this strain to grow under nutrient-limited conditions reaching a biomass value of 17.5 g L-1. The fatty acid profile obtained indicated potential industrial applications for R. mucilaginosa M1K4 oils, conformed primarily by oleic (54%), palmitic (28%), and linoleic acids (17%). Overall, this research provides valuable insights into optimizing the use of wastepaper hydrolysate for sustainable biotechnological applications.
